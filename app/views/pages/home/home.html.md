    	<p>Long before the women's suffrage movement brought about the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment in 1920, women were making themselves heard in a wide variety of ways that broadly transformed the American experience, including working for moral reform, abolition, and increased opportunities for education and employment. The Philadelphia region was among the most important centers for these movements.

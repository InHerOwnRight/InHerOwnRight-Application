  <h3>About the project</h3>
    <div class="lead"><em>In Her Own Right: Women Asserting Their Civil Rights, 1820-1920</em> showcases Philadelphia-area collections highlighting women’s struggle leading to the passage of the 19th Amendment.
    </div>
    <p>The In Her Own Right project is executed by members of the <a href="http://pacscl.org">Philadelphia Area Consortium of Special Collections Libraries (PACSCL)</a>, with funding from the National Endowment of the Humanities (NEH), the Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR), the Delmas Foundation, and the New Century Trust.</p>
    <p>The Greater Philadelphia region has a strong tradition of women’s initiatives to expand their rights and opportunities with regard to political participation, education, work, property-holding, and cultural activities. The region’s documentary collections reflect Philadelphia’s Quaker origins and the Quaker traditions of women’s equality and outspokenness; the city’s role as a center for African-American politics and culture; and the development of institutions such as the world’s first medical college for women.</p>
<p>Taken together, these collections demonstrate that the campaign for women’s suffrage did not happen in a vacuum, but was the result of decades of women of all kinds moving out of the home and into the schools and workplaces of the nation.</p>
    <p>From a survey of 45 collections in the holdings of 8 members of the Philadelphia Area Consortium of Special Collection Libraries, the pilot project focuses on providing a searchable database of primary source documents from seven project partners and contextual essays on overarching issues and these three themes:
<ul>
<li><a href="../essays/work_and_friendship_across_racial_lines.html.md">Working and making friends across racial lines</a></li>
<li><a href="../essays/philanthropy_or_self-determination?.md">Doing good works and practicing self-improvement in the progressive-era city</a></li>
<li><a href="../essays/medical_women.html.md">Confronting race, professionalism, and respectability in the medical profession </a></li></p>
</ul>
<p>The project data is available through the API for researchers to use freely.</p>
<p>Although the digitization of all surveyed materials was beyond the scope of the pilot project, users can search and browse brief descriptions of the additional collections, or download a listing of all collections. For more information, see the “Collection Guide” link at the top of the page.</p>
  <br/><h5>Technology</h5>
  <p>Project technology development was driven by an inspired and talented group of PACSCL repositories staff (see full list at right), with aggregation and application development by <a href="http://neomindlabs.com">Neomind Labs</a>.</p> 
<p>The application is built using Postgres and Ruby on Rails and incorporates an OAI-PMH harvester and API endpoint.</p>
<p>To encourage participation, basic metadata was required, and more robust metadata encouraged. Neomind harvested the original metadata, normalized and processed it, and saved both versions.</p>

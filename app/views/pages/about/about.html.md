      In Her Own Right: Women Asserting Their Civil Rights, 1820-1920” showcases Philadelphia-area collections highlighting women’s struggle leading to the passage of the 19th Amendment.
    </div>
    <p>
      The Greater Philadelphia region has a strong tradition of women’s initiatives to expand their rights and opportunities with regard to political participation, education, work, property-holding, and cultural activities. The region’s documentary collections reflect Philadelphia’s Quaker origins and the Quaker traditions of women’s equality and outspokenness; the city’s role as a center for African-American politics and culture; and the development of institutions such as the world’s first medical college for women.
    </p>

    <p>
      Taken together, these collections demonstrate that the campaign for women’s suffrage did not happen in a vacuum, but was the result of decades of women of all kinds moving out of the home and into the schools and workplaces of the nation.

    <p>
      From a survey of 45 collections in the holdings of 8 members of the Philadelphia Area Consortium of Special Collection Libraries, the pilot project focuses on providing a searchable database of primary source documents from seven project partners and contextual essays on overarching issues and these three themes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="../essays/work_and_friendship_across_racial_lines.html.md">Working and making friends across racial lines</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="../essays/philanthropy_or_self-determination?.md">Doing good works and practicing self-improvement in the progressive-era city</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="../essays/medical_women_confront_race,_professionalism,_respectability.md">Confronting race, professionalism, and respectability in the medical profession </a>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The project data is available through the API for researchers to use freely. Two examples of data use are [link].<!--a data visualization map showing the interconnections between [whatever] and a [link] timeline showing the growth of women’s activism across a variety of spheres.-->

      Although the digitization of all surveyed materials was beyond the scope of the pilot project, users can search and browse brief descriptions of the additional collections, or download a listing of all collections. For more information, see the “Collection Guide” link at the top of the page.

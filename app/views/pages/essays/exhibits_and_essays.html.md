### Nineteenth-century women’s activism: Breaking new ground on race and class

<div style="margin: 0px 40px 0px 30px">In the years between 1820 and 1920, women were as divided as they were united in their pursuit of expanded roles for themselves, with elite white women often pursuing their own rights at the expense of other groups. With the fledgling democracy finding its footing, women actively participated in benevolent reform and abolitionism, and, gradually, in the suffrage movement, peace activism, public health, and professionalization.
<br/><br/>
The materials here frame the history of the women’s rights movement as a series of dialogues between and among different groups of women. They help to identify those moments in which different groups of women talked to each other, capturing both the conflicts and the genuine moments of cultural exchange that resulted. Forced to confront their ideas about race, class, and womanhood, women activists were able to sharpen their agenda and move it forward. </div>

Athenaeum of Philadelphia,NEH,Sarah Josepha Hale Collection,"Hale, Sarah Josepha Buell, 1788-1879",1826-1869,,,Sarah Josepha Hale Collection,,,This collection of letters contains the correspondence of Sarah Josepha Buell Hale. It contains letters relating to both her professional and personal life and spans a 43 year period. It also contains a small number of letters between her close relatives.,"Sarah Josepha Buell Hale (1788-1879) was a major literary figure of the 19th century. Born in New Hampshire, she was educated at home and by her mother and brother, Horatio. She married a young lawyer, David Hale, who died in 1822. As a result she had to find a way to support herself and her five children. She utilized her literary skills and published a collection of poems with mild success followed by her first novel entitled Northwood in 1827. Northwood advocated the repatriation of slaves to Africa by means of Liberia and called for New England style morality throughout the nation. In 1828 she began editing The Ladies' Magazine of Boston, the first magazine for women to be edited by a woman. It had its financial difficulties and was united with Godey's Lady's Book (the majorly influential women's magazine of the 19th century) in 1837. Godey's was based in Philadelphia and she eventually she moved to Philadelphia from Boston to become more involved in her editorship of the magazine. These magazines acted as her platform to promote her moral agendas. She was a major proponent of equal education for women; however she was not a suffragist. She pushed for men and women to remain within their god-given spheres and believed women needed education to be better moral upholders of the home. Aside from being the editor of Godey's Lady's Book, she wrote many books and poems while lobbying for educational and social reform. Hale is also the author of Mary had a Little Lamb and the main person responsible for making Thanksgiving a national holiday (it was previously only celebrated in her native New England). Hale died in 1879 and was survived by four children (her oldest son died in 1839).",,

Clymer, a nurse famous for her appearance in Thomas Eakins' painting ""The Agnew Clinic."" Clymer was a student at the Training School for Nurses at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, from 1888 to 1889. ","The notes in this collection document the variety of experiences which were part of Clymer's educational program at the School, which included rotations in the hospital wards where she performed assigned duties under supervision of nursing school faculty and nursing staff employed by the hospital; as well as attendance at formal lectures taught by the medical school faculty. The Clymer notes were used extensively by Mary Virginia Stephenson, R.N., in writing The First Fifty Years of the Training School for Nurses of the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia: J. B. Lippincott Company, 1940). A note filed in with the Clymer papers read, ""Lecture notes taken by Mary V. Clymer 1887-1889/Mrs. George Baras [?], Given to M. V. Stephenson."" The manuscript has sometimes been cited as covering the period from 1887 to 1889; however, a close examination suggests that the notes actually date from the period between May 1888 and March 1889. The collection contains two small bound volumes. The first volume contains ward notes. Volume 1 also contains (starting from the back of the volume and working toward the middle) a rough set of lecture notes. The second volume contains a clean copy of the lecture notes which are found in Volume 1. The contents of the second volume appear to have been recopied from the draft version in Volume 1 and submitted for a grade. There is no pagination in either volume.",,

Bryn Mawr College,CLIR/Pilot,"M. Carey Thomas papers, 1853-1935","Thomas, M. Carey, 1857-1935",,,135 linear feet,BMC-CA-RG1-1DD2,http://www.brynmawr.edu/library/speccoll/guides/thomas.shtml,Female friendship,"The M. Carey Thomas Collection at Bryn Mawr College is comprised of documents from two principal sources: Carey Thomas's personal papers and the official records surviving from her career at Bryn Mawr College. The college archives includes Trustees' minutes, annual reports of the presidents to the Board of Trustees, faculty and administrative committee minutes, college bulletins and other publications which are not organized as presidential papers and are not included in the microfilm. The third series is the Bryn Mawr School Papers. The fourth series is comprised of six photograph albums compiled by Carrie Chapman Catt depicting the history of the women's suffrage movement. M. Carey Thomas's personal papers consist of incoming and outgoing correspondence, family letters, autobiographical papers, business records, memorabilia and other miscellaneous materials. The correspondence includes over 1,200 letters dating from 1883 to 1894 between M. Carey Thomas and her longtime companion Mary Elizabeth Garrett which were digitized for the In Her Own Right project, accounting for only a small portion of the total correspondence between these two women within this collection. Note that Bryn Mawr also holds the Mary Garrett Family Papers, (BMC-1970-01), which may be viewed at http://archives.tricolib.brynmawr.edu/repositories/6/resources/1467","This collection is particularly rich in documenting Thomas's commitment first and foremost to women's education as the basis for equality and secondarily her participation in the suffrage movement. Never one to mince words, her personality--judgmental and demanding but also indefatigable, funny, and erudite--comes across clearly even in official documents. Materials related to the college document daily goings-on, Thomas's educational philosophy, including the need for women's education in particular, and, perhaps most interestingly, her close involvement in the lives of her students. Copious documentation of her chapel addresses, which she gave several times a week, are especially fascinating. Here, she shared announcements, college business, and disciplinary actions, and she gave lessons in history, scripture, and reform. Interactions with students and ad-libs are also included. Her letters to Anna Howard Shaw and others, addresses to NAWSA conventions, and other documents identify her specific place in the suffrage movement. Firmly on the side of NAWSA in its conflict with the Congressional Union, she considered the newer group as ""hopelessly untruthful as the...anti-suffragists."" (Later, however, she supported the ERA.) Thomas's arguments in favor of suffrage often revealed a deep conservatism--she related a story of how her mother became a suffragist after she had to hold the reins for her ""ignorant negro coachman"" so he could vote and often spoke of the necessity of educated women's votes to cancel out those of ""foreign,"" ""ignorant,"" and ""criminal"" men--but she also emphasized working women's need for the vote. Carrie Chapman Catt albums, while not related to Thomas per se, provide a visual record of the movement. The letters between Thomas and Mary Elizabeth Garrett, digitized for In Her Own Right, are especially unique in that both sides of the correspondence has been preserved, creating a rich narrative via the experience of being able to read direct responses to the letters written to and from each woman. The range of years of the correspondence that Bryn Mawr College chose to digitize for the In Her Own Right project, 1883-1894, focuses heavily on the founding and running of Bryn Mawr School, Thomas's work at Bryn Mawr College, and the fundraising efforts of Garrett and Thomas for Johns Hopkins Medical School. ","This collection will be especially interesting to historians of education, especially women and education; although Thomas was involved in many other issues, even this participation was often connected to education in some way. Many of Thomas's letters, articles, and speeches were about the quality of American education more generally, although she also, of course, took a particular interest in arguing for women's education, the values of single-sex vs. coed education, and refuting the arguments of people such as Edward Clarke. From an institutional perspective, relationships between and among students, faculty, and administration--often contentious--also receive a great deal of coverage.

Mary Worthington's is not a mere line-a-day jotting of appointments and weather. Page after numbered page of thoughtful, often idealistic, narrative draws the reader into her life. She was young, she was an ardent suffragist, she was a member of the English Quaker Whitall family, she was a college woman shortly after the turn of the century.","These diaries are both delightful and revealing, with Worthington moving seamlessly from discussions of extracurricular activities, especially theater, handsome young men, bickering among friends, and rivalries between classes to such issues as suffrage, Free Trade, socialism, and government corruption.

AWH personnel continued to labor extensively in the last three areas during the 1920s and 1930s and added services to Serbia, Russia, Asia, and the rural United States. The outbreak of World War II returned their attention to Western Europe as projects of emergency medical relief were made necessary in war zones. In the post-war period, the AWH worked to shift administrative and professional duties to the home country in Greece and France, and financed the training and employment of native female personnel in China, Japan, Haiti, India, Southeast Asia, and the Philippines.

Executive Committee minutes also include committee reports, budgets, and resolutions, but they are more hands-on in terms of the day-to-day happenings in the hospital and its nurse training program, including students' grades, relationships between students and instructors, and what constituted proper training. Annual reports are the most detailed of all, with comprehensive breakdowns of patients and treatments.

In 1929, the West Philadelphia Hospital for Women merged with the Woman's Hospital of Philadelphia, retaining the latter's name. The Woman's Hospital of Philadelphia continued in existence until 1964 when it was absorbed by the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. The collection contains minutes of the Board of Managers and various committees, dating from 1861 to 1964; financial records, including auditor's reports and bequests, and dating from 1894 to 1964; clinical reports, dating from the 1890s; a register of deaths dating from 1872 to 1890; board of manager minutes (1863 to 1881) and pamphlets and bulletins (1923-1924; 1957-1960) from the hospital's Training School for Nurses.",,"Board of Managers meeting minutes are interesting largely to the extent that they show women running a business. In addition to appointing officers, forming committees, electing members, and reading reports, they sought incorporation, looked for a building, dealt with maintenance and facility issues, and administered budgets. Beyond this, many of the richest aspects of the meeting minutes--bylaws about whom to admit and at what rate, statements on the need for a woman's hospital, and breakdowns of patients seen and treatments administered--are included in annual reports. In addition to detailed discussions of these subjects, annual reports will be of great interest to historians of women's education and employment. Researchers will be able to see how training of, and expectations for, women doctors and nurses evolved. Of particular interest are the regularly included rules for nurses, which lay out requirements for age, intelligence, character, behavior, and duties, and applications for the nurse training school, which include personal questions about marital status, children, health issues, height and weight, race, and religious denomination.",

She graduated from the first class of the Female Medical College of Pennsylvania (later the Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania) in 1851, served on the faculty, founded the Woman's Hospital of Philadelphia and a nursing school, and became the first woman dean of the Female Medical College in 1866. This collection documents Dr. Preston's early life and, to a lesser degree, her medical career and the successes as well as the challenges that she and other women physicians faced in the mid nineteenth century.","Most of the materials in this collection deal with Preston's childhood or are photocopies from the Chester County Historical Society. Folders 5 and 6 include a number of documents-- including published texts, lectures, and commencement addresses--that shed light on how women justified their participation in medicine in the mid-nineteenth century. While Preston acknowledged that the home was woman's sphere, she did not believe they should be confined there. Many women had children to support, and medicine represented a more remunerative and less time-consuming option than sewing or washing. She also argued that women were better at treating other women. In addition to these material and moral concerns, she believed that women should be allowed to study medicine simply because ""the exercise of their own judgment and conscience"" directed them to do so.","These papers will be interesting to scholars studying not only the challenges faced by women physicians, including opposition from male physicians and male-dominated institutions, but also those studying the evolution of feminist thought. Preston drew on arguments that women should study medicine both because they were the same as men and because they were different from men. In doing so, she navigated several different intellectual discourses, including natural rights theory, separate spheres ideology, civilization theory, and national pride. These papers thus show how these ideas presented both problems and opportunities to women arguing for expanded rights. Finally, historians of women's education will note that these sources reflect nineteenth- and twentieth-century college women's broader sense of a shared mission.",

The collection documents Marshall's role as a faculty member and Dean including her efforts in expanding the program and facilities, and relationships with local and national schools and organizations, as well as containing student records.","During Clara Marshall 's tenure as dean of WMCP (1888-1917) professionalization attempts proliferated. Through extensive correspondence and scattered other sources, this collection highlights how these attempts cut both ways for WMCP. In this and other ways, these papers also contribute to understanding the institutional history of the school, documenting enrollment, alumnae publications, and more through reports and pamphlets. They also highlight the school's continued involvement in missionary work. Finally, this collection demonstrates Marshall's participation in other aspects of the women's rights movement, particularly suffrage, and includes correspondence from such prominent women as Alice Stone Blackwell, Mary Putnam Jacobi, and Lida Stokes Adams.","This collection will be of interest to scholars studying the relationship between women's institutions and male-dominated professionalization attempts. While women leaders often welcomed professionalization as a means of attaining legitimacy, a perennial lack of funding often made such recognition impossible. There is also some evidence that shows a connection between WMCP and the woman suffrage movement, including a letter from Lida Stokes Adams to Marshall and a paper Marshall read before National American Woman Suffrage Association.

One of the two more specific scrapbooks focuses on the Alice Tallant Affair; the other was compiled by Dr. Rachel L. Bodley, Dean of the College from 1874-1888. Each scrapbook covers a particular period of time with the total time period covered from 1867 to 1972 with single clippings dating to 1854.","This collection includes clippings from local, national, and international newspapers, feminist publications, and medical publications. Additionally, clippings include coverage of Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania (WMC) commencement exercises, announcements, and other student activities. The first thirty years of clippings are largely dedicated to debates over whether or not women should be doctors. Around the turn of the century, opposition to women doctors abated somewhat, partially replaced by a discourse in which educated women served as a symbol of white, Christian America to the rest of the world, particularly in missionary work. Coverage of women's participation in the war effort begins around 1915, as does more extensive discussion of progressive public health initiatives. There is also some evidence of connections to the suffrage movement.","These clippings allow researchers to analyze how discourses about women doctors changed between 1869 and 1923, as well as how these perceptions were related to national and international developments. Clippings are less rich, although still helpful, in documenting how women physicians thought of themselves. Women doctors regularly responded to opposition, and students occasionally took action to take control of their own education. Researchers should keep in mind that these scrapbooks were created by WMCP personnel, which makes tracking change over time difficult (collecting patterns may have changed).",

In 1914 the Annual Announcement was published with the quarterly publication, Bulletin of Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania. The Annual Announcement continued into the 1980s.","WMCP's Annual Announcements shed light on academics, demographics, and values. Increasingly detailed breakdowns of courses, recommended reading, and faculty members reveal a curriculum that grew more rigorous to support a profession that was becoming more specialized. Additionally, course offerings reveal the confluence between medicine and Progressive and feminist reform. A course on hygiene, eventually supported by the US Social Hygiene Board, included visits to factories, water-filtration plants, and other sites. It also addressed aspects of social medicine, including sex hygiene and control of venereal disease. Announcements also offer some insights into the kind of students who attended WMC, their career prospects after graduation, and the kinds of students WMC tried to recruit. In addition to listing places of residence for students and alumnae, as well as those in the latter category who received hospital appointments, announcements describe the kinds of financial aid available to prospective students.

Wilbur was an active anti-slavery and women's rights proponent during the 19th century. The daughter of Mary Lapham and Stephen Wilbur, Julia was born into a Quaker family on August 8, 1815, near Rochester, New York. In 1844, Julia began teaching in the Rochester public school system. She notes several times in her journals her frustration at the wage gap between male and female teachers--an injustice that likely helped fuel her later engagement with women's rights efforts. One notable event is Julia's early life was her initial interaction with Harriet Jacobs in April of 1849. Jacobs, herself a freed slave, would eventually befriend Julia during their work with freed and escaped slaves in Alexandria, Virginia. It is also important to recognize Julia's early involvement with the Rochester Ladies' Anti-Slavery Society, for which she served as a correspondence secretary. Julia's life changed markedly in April of 1858, when her sister, Sarah, died. As a result of this tragedy, Julia became the guardian of Freda, Sarah's daughter. Julia seems to have taken well to her new, motherly role. Yet, things took a turn for the worse in January of 1860, when Freda's father, who had recently remarried, decided to claim custody of Freda. Having her niece so abruptly pulled from her life was devastating for Julia; she was launched into a severe depression that continued for about two years. Fortunately, Julia's unhappiness did ultimately lift. This emotional shift was triggered in large part by her move to Alexandria, Virginia in October of 1862. Sent to Virginia by the Rochester Ladies' Anti-Slavery Society, Wilbur worked there alongside Harriet Jacobs providing supplies and education to freed slaves. This work was emotionally and physically taxing for Julia and exposed her to the sufferings of others in a very personal way. In 1865, Julia made yet another shift by moving to Washington, DC. She became increasingly involved with the women's rights movement and also took a job working in the U.S. Patent Office. According to a letter written by Julia's great-niece, Julia was the first woman admitted to work in this office. Julia spent her last years living in Washington D.C. with her sister, Frances, until her death in 1895. ","This collection is comprised of Julia Wilbur's personal journals, which span from 1844 to 1895. It is important to note that Julia's journals vary in type. The first journal variety, which includes the years 1856-57 and 1860-95, are pocket-sized, individual books. The second journal style is larger in dimension than the first set. They are not bound books, but instead are individual pages that have been sewn together. These journals go from 1844 to 1873. There is some overlap in time among the different journal varieties, specifically for 1856-1857 and 1860-1873. Comparing corresponding entries reveals generally similar content, often with further elaboration in the entries of the second journal type due to the increase in writing space. Julia also wrote what she refers to as ""journal briefs"" for the years 1844 through 1862. These briefs offer summaries of her entries for those year and presumably represent what Julia saw as the most significant events that had occurred during those times. https://www.alexandriava.gov/uploadedFiles/historic/info/civilwar/JuliaWilburDiary1860to1866.pdf http://www.paulawhitacre.com/",,

Rebecca White maintained a friendship with abolitionist and educator Sarah Mapps Douglass. The collection includes thirteen letters from Douglass to White, written between 1854 and Douglass's death in 1882. Letters describe Douglass's religious journey, her fondness for Rebecca, her own family history (with a particular focus on her mother and grandfather) and their attempts to confront racism, her time at Woman's Medical College, and the challenges of teaching.","Rebecca White’s papers reveal much about her philanthropic and religious interests, but the highlight of the collection is her correspondence with Sarah Mapps Douglass. While Douglass was a leader in the Philadelphia Female Anti-Slavery Society, these letters are unique in providing her individual voice--particularly important for a movement that was for African Americans but for which the bulk of the extant documents come from white women. These letters, by contrast, offer an illuminating look at Douglass's activism and the challenges she faced, as well as the nature of an interracial friendship in the nineteenth-century US.",

Thus, these papers provide a wealth of documentation on evolving suffrage strategies, including lobbying legislators, holding open-air meetings and parades, and organizing the Liberty Bell tour. Further, they demonstrate the close relationship between state and national activism, detailing the frequent visits Alice Paul and others made to Pennsylvania and the participation of many Pennsylvania women in picketing the White House, along with their subsequent imprisonment. They also document some of the conflict within the suffrage movement, including between NAWSA and the NWP, as well as the role of race within the movement.

The records of the New Century Trust include their own and mostly those of the New Century Guild and its predecessor, New Century Working Women's Guild.

Both meeting minutes and office account books also provide insight into the kinds of evening classes the Guild offered. Given that the organization shared DNA with the Consumers League (Florence Kelley was a founder), it is not surprising that these sources place special emphasis on investigating and improving the working conditions of women and girls. Other points of discussion involved suffrage, home life and paid work, and women's contributions to the war effort. Extant copies of publications, clippings, conference programs, etc., date almost entirely from later in the 20th century.","Despite the presence of such prominent Philadelphians as Lucretia Blankenburg and Charlotte Peirce on the Executive Board, the fact that the Guild aimed to be an organization by and for working women allows their voices to come through. The Guild thus differed from many other organizations established for working women in the same era. Members were proud to work for wages and based much of their identity on this activity, particularly interesting given the wide range of occupations represented by the Guild's membership.

Beyond the visible drama of arrests and imprisonment (including her correspondence from prison), Lewis's letters also document the long, slow work of organizing. Prolific in her communication with family members, Dora's letters trace her fundraising and lobbying efforts across the country, and offer a glimpse into the inner workings of NWP.

There is also some discussion of petitioning the state legislature, as well as of related issues including women's employment, the single tax movement, the arguments of anti-suffragists, and suffrage developments elsewhere in the nation.

This volume is interesting largely for its documentation of how the suffrage movement had changed by the twentieth century's second decade. Suffragists by this point were increasingly using public tactics; members of the Woman Suffrage Party of Logan held open-air meetings, hung banners across Broad Street, advertised in newspapers, staged theater performances, monitored polling places, attended hearings in the state legislature, and actively worked to defeat state politicians who voted against state suffrage. There is little to no discussion of some important national and even state-level developments in the suffrage movement; for example, minutes do not explicitly mention the failed 1915 state referendum, although they do discuss the successful 1919 state campaign. Originally the Germantown (Philadelphia) branch of the Woman Suffrage Party, this organization changed its name to the Pennsylvania League of Women Citizens in 1919, when Pennsylvania women won the right to vote.","The notable absences in these papers make it difficult for researchers to glean much about the particular trajectory of the Pennsylvania suffrage campaign.

Mira Sharpless Townsend (1798-1859) was born in Philadelphia, attended Friends Select School, and in 1828 married Samuel Townsend (1800-1887). He was a member of Philadelphia Monthly Meeting by whom she had six children, only two surviving to adulthood: Emily Sharpless Townsend who married Powell Stackhouse and Clara Gordon Townsend, married William Penn Troth. During the 1840's, Mira Townsend became an active and vocal social activist who wrote and published a variety of poetry and articles which reflected her strong views regarding women, slavery, temperance and capital punishment.

She also was the driving force behind the founding of the Rosine Association. In January 1847, at a meeting of the Society for the Abolition of Capital Punishment, she announced her desire to form a society ""to open a house for the reformation, employment and instruction of females, who had led immoral lives."" The result was the establishment of the Rosine. Mira Townsend was on the committee of five to create a Constitution and served as a Manager and Treasurer for the organization until her death. Encouraged by the support for the Rosine Association, Mira Townsend, together with others including her sister Eliza Parker, established a Temporary Home, a boarding house for destitute women and children. Townsend traveled to Harrisburg to petition the all-male state legislature for funding which was approved, and her case books record in detail her visits to unfortunate women.

Her extensive collection of correspondence, poetry, and related materials reflect her goals and political and social activism, and the case books offer documention of the lives of the women she sought to help. Her journals, letters, and poetry reflect her devotion to friends and family, especially to her two daughters, and her wide range of interests.","Includes two manuscript ledger case books, 1847-1858, describing in minute detail the case histories of over 270 individual women, who were admitted as inmates and clients of the Rosine Association during the first ten years of its existence in Philadelphia. The vast majority of the rescued women were between the ages of 14 and 30 and native born from not only the Philadelphia-Pennsylvania region but also several northern and southern states. Most of the foreign born women were from northern Europe with those from Ireland being most prevalent by far.

Also included are financial and legal papers and School bulletins, annual reports, and some other papers. Among the correspondents are Martha Schofield's extended family and Susan B. Anthony.","This collection provides a fascinating look into Schofield's personal life and activism. Her letters and diaries convey a harrowing picture of how the Civil War affected the daily lives of Northerners, as well as the ways in which Schofield contributed to the war effort, including sending food, sewing, and money; working in a hospital; and aiding contraband. Yet, as a Quaker, it was difficult to reconcile her antislavery sentiments with her pacifist beliefs, and her letters describe this struggle as well. In 1865, she was appointed a teacher with the Pennsylvania Relief Association, and from this point on sources document her move South, teaching, and eventually the establishment of her own school. Sources also chart her growing involvement in the suffrage movement, including her views on why women should have the right to vote and her friendship with Susan B. Anthony. The collection does include a few gaps-- outgoing letters are less common after 1865, and diaries from 1863-64 and 1872-91 are not included--but each form is so compelling and revealing on its own. Schofield was remarkably candid and reflective, not only about politics but also about her personal life, including her friendship with Sadie Brower--a classic nineteenth-century romantic friendship that included referring to Sadie as her wife and deep depression when Sadie got married--and her attempts to map out unconventional relationships with men. Beyond letters and diaries, Schofield penned many articles on such issues as women's rights and racial equality.","Beyond charting Schofield's involvement in abolitionism, the war effort, educational initiatives, and suffrage, the collection documents the ways in which nineteenth-century women attempted to create satisfying lives for themselves outside of marriage and motherhood. Of particular interest is the fact that Schofield was so young (early twenties) when she produced much of this writing, making her relatable to students. Despite the presence of some cross-writing, her handwriting is highly readable.",

She was also a member of the Brooklyn Women's Club from 1888 until her death, was a charter member of the New York League for Political Education, and was instrumental in founding the Friends Equal Rights Association.

Includes the papers and drawings of Graceanna Lewis, prominent Quaker natural scientist and social reformer. Educated at the Kimberton Boarding School, she also taught at a number of female seminaries, including a boarding school managed by her uncle, Bartholomew Fussell, and the Foster School for Girls at Clifton Springs, N.Y. Of particular interest is her correspondence with a cousin concerning phrenology and a school for black children in which he was teaching, and her manuscript memoirs of the Underground Railroad.","These papers offer windows into abolitionism, Quakers and militarism, and female friendships and professionalism. Graceanna Lewis belonged to a family of reformers and was in a circle that involved many others, including Cyrus and Charles Burleigh and William Still. Her correspondence addresses issues including the Abby Kelley controversy over female participation in antislavery work and the Underground Railroad. The latter is also addressed in an unpublished memoir Lewis wrote in 1912. She discussed her parents' opposition to slavery, the fugitives who hid on their property, and the contributions of other local abolitionists. Additionally, these papers shed light on the difficulties the Civil War posed to Quakers who were both antislavery and antiwar. Lewis's writings also show how her work was sometimes in concert with, and sometimes at odds with, her politics. As a teacher, she did not hesitate to talk to her students about slavery, even if their parents would object. However, she was also a scientist, which led her to embrace phrenology and scientific racism. A final thread that runs through this collection is that of female friendships, expressed in Lewis's lifelong friendship with Hannah Mifflin.","The papers reflect many interesting issues, but may be best suited to supplement a study of the abolitionist community than they are as windows into Lewis's own life and activism. Additionally, while Lewis certainly exercised agency through her pursuit of an unconventional career, she did not really focus on the gendered aspects of slavery or on women's rights per se.",

They discuss Lewis's friendship with and fondness for Jane Addams, as well as her interactions with other prominent women, including Emily Greene Balch, Jeannette Rankin, and Florence Kelley. She also discusses topics including Wilson and the peace process, the state of postwar Europe, post-war relief efforts, Russian politics, and working with Hoover.","These letters serve as a candid supplement to the more official Woman's Peace Party papers, shedding light on some of the activists involved and the real, on-the-ground difficulties they faced in working for peace.",

She personally lobbied members of Congress to pass a special act admitting women to the bar of the Court, and first practiced before the Court in 1879. Among other cases, Lockwood successfully represented the Eastern Cherokee Indians in an five million dollar suit before the Court. She also represented hundreds of family members of Civil War veterans in their pension claims. Lockwood was also an ardent supporter of women's rights. She lectured and toured the country in attempts to gather support for woman suffrage. Lockwood ran for the U.S. presidency in 1884 and 1888, being the first woman to have a complete, national campaign for that office. Both times she was the Presidential candidate for the National Equal Rights Party, capturing over 4,000 votes in six states.  Her other feminist activities included serving as president of the Woman's National Press Association, and being appointed Attorney General of the American Woman's Republic, an organization founded by Marietta Stowe and dedicated to preparing women for the rights and responsibilities of full citizenship. From the 1870s onward Lockwood was active with the radical peace group, the Universal Peace Union, representing the organization at several international peace congresses.  As an executive board member of the Universal Peace Union, Lockwood attended many international peace congresses. She wrote tracts on international arbitration and was one of the nominating members of the Nobel Peace Prize Committee.","The Papers of Belva Ann Lockwood are an assortment of writings both by and about her. The papers include correspondence (1885-1915), pamphlets, manuscripts, and newspaper and journal articles. The bulk of the correspondence is between Lockwood and Alfred H. Love of the Universal Peace Union, and from Lockwood to her nephew, Frank Gardner, and his wife Lella Gardner. A few of Lockwood's writings and law briefs are in the collection. Much of Lockwood's office files and personal papers were destroyed soon after her death. The manuscripts consist primarily of personal accounts by Lockwood of speeches and important law cases. Newspaper clippings and articles document Lockwood's involvement in the woman suffrage and peace movements, as well as her legal and political activities.

Correspondence to and from Balch spans the years from 1875 until her death in 1961. A gap from 1907 until 1913 may have been caused by a fire at Wellesley in 1914, when many papers were destroyed. A considerable amount of important correspondence (1920-c. 1941) relates to the affairs of Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF), an international organization which Balch led for many years. Her writings (1884-1956) include articles and speeches-- some published, others in manuscript, draft, or note form--as well as letters to the editor, book reviews, poems, a song, and research notes. There are many writings pertaining to Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF).

Later autobiographical writing also attributes her political awakening to her time at Bryn Mawr.","The significance of this collection to the current project largely depends on how parameters are defined. Balch was connected to Philadelphia because she was educated at Bryn Mawr, and materials from her years there do some shed light on how she became the activist that she did.

The collection covers the period from 1891 to 1981, with the bulk of the material dated 1960- 1980.

Minutes also include some discussion of women's contributions to the war effort, supplemented by patriotic materials that can be found in scrapbooks. Program minutes from 1891 to 1900 are especially interesting. Early entries include narrative accounts of each evening's activities--how many young women came, what the night's entertainment was, etc. As evidence of the association's efficacy, they include quotations from attendees emphasizing how grateful they are and how anxious they are to get into classes (albeit from the perspective of board members). Later accounts feature class rosters with the names, addresses, and occupations of students. Many of them were domestic or factory workers (especially in the garment trades), but there were also a handful of dressmakers, tailoresses, clerks, stenographers, and teachers.","This collection is interesting largely as an institutional history or in the context of other, similar organizations formed around the same time, including but not limited to other YWCAs.

Other topics covered include debates over whether to affiliate with the Philadelphia YWCA, women's work conditions and labor laws, and contributions to the war effort. Two books included in the collection, The Handbook of the Young Women's Christian Association Movement (1916) and Elizabeth Wilson, Fifty Years of Association Work among Young Women (1916), provide detailed histories of the Y movement, although they are not specific to Philadelphia.

Some of the accomplishments of the Association include the removal of Chief Labor Inspector Delaney in 1908; strengthen the existing, although inadequate, child labor laws, which it successfully did with a new child labor act 1915. The new act called for a nine hour day; a fifty-two hour week; and that children under varying ages attend approved vocational school for not less than one half day per work week.

Also included are glass lantern slides, negatives, and photographic reprints relating to the Association's properties and community activities, and depicting housing interiors and exteriors before and after renovations, court yards, and street scenes around Philadelphia.","The diaries detail Helen Parrish's ""friendly visits"" to her tenants. Like other early social welfare work, these visits were incredibly invasive, policing tenants' sexual behavior, childcare practices, financial decisions, and drinking habits. Race relations, especially interracial relationships, come up frequently. Interestingly, unlike social welfare programs aimed exclusively at women (mothers' pensions, for example, and, later, ADC), Parrish policed the behavior of both men and women. She mentions many of the same people several times, making it possible for researchers to trace their stories. Correspondence is mostly incoming, including several letters from Octavia Hill and her sister, Miranda. Notes and speeches go the furthest in documenting the influences on Parrish and the OHA, as well as their very specific vision for how best to practice charity. Meanwhile, subseries on legislative involvement and speeches, conferences, and reports best document the actions the OHA pursued.","It is rare for historical figures to lay out their thoughts, influences, and goals so explicitly. Helen Parrish emerges as a figure as complex and compelling as Jane Addams, one whose life and work encapsulate the central paradox of Progressivism as both altruistic and coercive.

Founded in 1819, the Female Hebrew Benevolent Society was the first Jewish charitable organization in Philadelphia, and the first such organization in the United States to offer free basic Jewish religious education. In the first year of operation, attendance at the school grew to 80 students, a number which represented nearly 90 percent of the Jewish children in Philadelphia at the time. The Female Hebrew Benevolent Society operated the Sunday School until 1858 when it was incorporated as the Hebrew Sunday School Society (HSSS). Rebecca Gratz served as president of the organization until she was 80 years of age. The Hebrew Sunday School Society records house the organizational records of HSSS. This collection, which dates from 1802 to 2002, consists of minutes, reports, correspondence, budgets and financial statements, staff and student lists, event programs, clippings, books and research materials, photographs, lantern slides, pins, plaques, and other memorabilia. These records and materials document the history and evolution of HSSS and evidence an organization concerned with the betterment of Jewish children through religious education, including those with special needs. The collection is a unique and rich example of the growth and establishment of the first Hebrew Sunday schools that existed outside of any synagogue, with records that provide a look into how decisions were made over the course of the Society’s existence regarding what and how to teach, as well as a look into Jewish life in Philadelphia.","The pre-1920 materials in this collection shed significant light on the operations of the school. Minutes and annual reports describe academic activities and procedural matters, and there is also some insight into the school’s educational philosophy. Students were to be as quiet as possible, stay in their desks, and repeat their teachers’ words, and teachers were to be “kind” but “strict.” Also of interest are materials produced about students. For the school’s 75th anniversary in 1889, administrators solicited notes from former students listing their dates of attendance. A list of those who responded appears in the event’s program. The Northern School’s record of pupils is also extant between 1890 and 1903. It includes students’ names, ages, and addresses, as well as their fathers’ (occasionally mothers’) names and occupations, pointing to class and residential patterns.","These records are important for the history of Jewish institution building in Philadelphia, but they have less to say about the history of women’s rights, although the very existence of the school reflects Rebecca Gratz’s dedicated activism. Later remembrances of Gratz included in this collection do include some biographical information about her, but they shed more light on how she functioned as a symbol than on who she was as a person or activist.",

The farm was founded by Sheeder’s grandfather, Frederick Sheeder (1777-1865), an immigrant from Germany who arrived in Pennsylvania at the age of 16.  In 1799, Frederick Sheeder purchased a plot of land bordering French Creek and began farming land that would be passed on to Joseph Sheeder, J. Frederick Sheeder, and Anna Sheeder. 

The diaries cover Anna Sheeder’s life as a young adult from age 16 to 25.  During this period, Sheeder completed high school, attended West Chester Normal School (now West Chester University), and, following her graduation in 1874, worked as a schoolteacher for several years.  From 1888 to 1901, she maintained the Sheeder farm account books and would eventually oversee the operation of the family farm, which specialized in dairy cattle.  

Diary entries are intermittent and limited to no more than a page a day—for some periods, there are entries every day interspersed between gaps of months or even seasons.  Topics include the weather, chores, leisure activities, teaching, notable events in her daily life, and a summer vacationing in Atlantic City, New Jersey.  Some notable events include seeking employment at a mill, choking on a raw oyster, beginning a star quilt, romantic interests, disciplining students, and the death of an acquaintance.

Wood Forten belonged to the same elite African American circles in Philadelphia as Amy Matilda Cassey. Like Cassey’s, Wood Forten’s album was the collaborative production of a close-knit community. Her husband Robert B. Forten came from one of Philadelphia’s prominent African American families, and his siblings Mary Isabella and James Forten, Jr. contributed to the album. It contains verses and inscriptions that display the refinement and respectability of elite African American men and women, and in some cases speak directly to the abolitionist cause. ",

The first objective of the new society was to secure passage of a state law allowing for active prosecution in cases of child abuse. This was achieved after more than a year of work. The Society then had two alternatives in proven cases of child abuse: either disciplining the parents and returning their child to them or placing the child in a foster home. Various homes in the city were used for the temporary placement of children pending a decision on their cases. Gradually, the Society's agents conducted more detailed investigations of the cases, and it is the results of these investigations, the case records, that form the bulk of the collection.",,,

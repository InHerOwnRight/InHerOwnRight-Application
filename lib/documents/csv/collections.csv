She graduated from the first class of the Female Medical College of Pennsylvania (later the Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania) in 1851, served on the faculty, founded the Woman's Hospital of Philadelphia and a nursing school, and became the first woman dean of the Female Medical College in 1866. This collection documents Dr. Preston's early life and, to a lesser degree, her medical career and the successes as well as the challenges that she and other women physicians faced in the mid nineteenth century.","Most of the materials in this collection deal with Preston's childhood or are photocopies from the Chester County Historical Society. Folders 5 and 6 include a number of documents—including published texts, lectures, and commencement addresses—that shed light on how women justified their participation in medicine in the mid-nineteenth century. While Preston acknowledged that the home was woman's sphere, she did not believe they should be confined there. Many women had children to support, and medicine represented a more remunerative and less time-consuming option than sewing or washing. She also argued that women were better at treating other women. In addition to these material and moral concerns, she believed that women should be allowed to study medicine simply because &quot;the exercise of their own judgment and conscience&quot; directed them to do so.","These papers will be interesting to scholars studying not only the challenges faced by women physicians, including opposition from male physicians and male-dominated institutions, but also those studying the evolution of feminist thought. Preston drew on arguments that women should study medicine both because they were the same as men and because they were different from men. In doing so, she navigated several different intellectual discourses, including natural rights theory, separate spheres ideology, civilization theory, and national pride. These papers thus show how these ideas presented both problems and opportunities to women arguing for expanded rights. Finally, historians of women's education will note that these sources reflect nineteenth- and twentieth-century college women's broader sense of a shared mission."

The bulk of this collection consists of correspondence between Dr. Bodley and various WMCP faculty, students, and alumnae. The collection also contains academic and administrative documents. Examples of the administrative materials includes WMCP faculty by-laws, Examination Committee reports, and financial records. Academic material such as published speeches and lectures provide a robust insight into the institution's mission, goals and methods during the last quarter of the nineteenth century. This collection also includes material that elucidates Dr. Bodley's interest in medical missionary work.",,"These papers will primarily draw researchers interested in institutional history. However, they also highlight the development of a network of women professionals centered around WMCP. Letters from students, alumnae, faculty, physicians at other institutions, and perhaps most of all prospective students across the nation demonstrate the prestige of WMCP, while Bodley's report on alumnae shows how graduates expanded this network."

Marshall graduated from WMCP in 1875 and soon after became a Professor of Materia Medica. The collection documents Marshall's role as a faculty member and Dean including her efforts in expanding the program and facilities, and relationships with local and national schools and organizations, as well as containing student records.



","During Clara Marshall 's tenure as dean of WMCP (1888-1917) professionalization attempts proliferated. Through extensive correspondence and scattered other sources, this collection highlights how these attempts cut both ways for WMCP. In this and other ways, these papers also contribute to understanding the institutional history of the school, documenting enrollment, alumnae publications, and more through reports and pamphlets. They also highlight the school's continued involvement in missionary work. Finally, this collection demonstrates Marshall's participation in other aspects of the women's rights movement, particularly suffrage, and includes correspondence from such prominent women as Alice Stone Blackwell, Mary Putnam Jacobi, and Lida Stokes Adams.","This collection will be of interest to scholars studying the relationship between women's institutions and male-dominated professionalization attempts. While women leaders often welcomed professionalization as a means of attaining legitimacy, a perennial lack of funding often made such recognition impossible. There is also some evidence that shows a connection between WMCP and the woman suffrage movement, including a letter from Lida Stokes Adams to Marshall and a paper Marshall read before National American Woman Suffrage Association. These papers will be useful to researchers interested in the role of professional women in the suffrage movement."

Tracy's writings include coverage of cancer, preventive medicine, women in medicine, and ethics. ","Martha Tracy (1875-1942) was dean of Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania (WMCP) from 1918 to 1940. Some of these materials, including several materials about the history of WMCP, speak to an earlier era, including continued attempts at increased professional standing. Speeches and printed materials, meanwhile, demonstrate how justifications for women's participation in medicine had changed (or not) in the half century since Preston served as dean. Other documents, including correspondence with such women as Anna Howard Shaw and Lucretia Blankenburg, demonstrate the connection between WMC and others aspects of the women's rights movement, as well as its continued participation in missionary work. The collection includes several photographs of Tracy.","Historians of professionalization will find materials on the extent to which WMCP had attained professional standing by this point, as well as the continued difficulties the institution faced. Historians of feminism, meanwhile, will be interested to note the continued salience of arguments about both women's similarities to and differences from men as justification for their participation in medicine. Researchers hoping to learn more about Tracy's life will also find much of interest, as posthumous memorials provide significant biographical material."

All scrapbooks are of a general nature, covering any topic relevant to the school and hospital and were compiled anonymously, most likely by the public relations department in later years. One of the two more specific scrapbooks focuses on the Alice Tallant Affair; the other was compiled by Dr. Rachel L. Bodley, Dean of the College from 1874-1888. Each scrapbook covers a particular period of time with the total time period covered being from 1867 to 1972 with single clippings dating to 1854.","This collection includes clippings from local, national, and international newspapers, feminist publications, and medical publications. Additionally, clippings include coverage of Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania (WMC) commencement exercises, announcements, and other student activities. The first thirty years of clippings are largely dedicated to debates over whether or not women should be doctors. Around the turn of the century, opposition to women doctors abated somewhat, partially replaced by a discourse in which educated women served as a symbol of white, Christian America to the rest of the world, particularly in missionary work. Coverage of women's participation in the war effort begins around 1915, as does more extensive discussion of progressive public health initiatives. There is also some evidence of connections to the suffrage movement.","These clippings allow researchers to analyze how discourses about women doctors changed between 1869 and 1923, as well as how these perceptions were related to national and international developments. Clippings are less rich, although still helpful, in documenting how women physicians thought of themselves. Women doctors regularly responded to opposition, and students occasionally took action to take control of their own education. Researchers should keep in mind that these scrapbooks were created by WMCP personnel, which makes tracking change over time difficult (collecting patterns may have changed)."

In 1929, the hospital merged with the Woman's Hospital of Philadelphia. At the time of the merger, it was arranged that all maternity cases would be sent to the West Philadelphia Hospital, and surgical cases would be kept at the Woman's Hospital of Philadelphia. The Woman's Hospital of Philadelphia continued in existence until 1964 when it was absorbed by the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. The collection contains Board of Manager records, Executive Committee records and historical materials.The West Philadelphia Hospital for Women records are arranged in three series: &quot;Board of Managers records,&quot; &quot;Executive Committee records,&quot; and &quot;Historical materials.&quot; The &quot;Board of Managers records&quot; includes Regular Monthly Meeting minutes from 1889 to 1901 and 1917 to 1932; Annual Meeting Minutes from 1920 to 1929; and Annual Reports from 1890 to 1893, 1904 to 1910, 1913 to 1914, and 1918 to 1927. The &quot;Executive Committee records&quot; include Regular Monthly Meeting minutes from 1908 to 1914. The &quot;Historical materials&quot; series consists of a history of the Hospital, circa 1899; rules for the Superintendent and Directress of Nurses, 1901; the Charter and By-Laws of the West Philadelphia Hospital for Women, 1912; Broomall Club new members letter, 1916; a descriptive brochure, 1917; and the resolution to merge with Woman's Hospital of Philadelphia, circa 1929.","Board of Managers minutes are procedural, with more space devoted to committee reports, budgets, and resolutions than to the practice of medicine. However, they do shed light on institutional and treatment practices, noting the number of patients admitted (including free or at reduced rates), prescriptions written, and surgeries performed, as well as listing hospital staff and discussing the kinds of equipment and facilities they need. Executive Committee minutes also include committee reports, budgets, and resolutions, but they are more hands-on in terms of the day-to-day happenings in the hospital and its nurse training program, including students' grades, relationships between students and instructors, and what constituted proper training. Annual reports are the most detailed of all, with comprehensive breakdowns of patients and treatments. They also include tables of income, disbursements, and donations, as well as pictures of the facilities.","In addition to the importance of the annual reports, historians who study women's voluntary organizations will find these papers useful. From the beginning, they show hospital leaders running the institution like a business, very much in keeping with the organizational patterns of women's benevolent work earlier in the nineteenth century. Other women's historians will note with interest the participation of philanthropist Anna T. Jeanes. Researchers of the history of medicine will find these materials very instructive in illustrating how treatment and training programs changed over the course of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries."

In addition to appointing officers, forming committees, electing members, and reading reports, they sought incorporation, looked for a building, dealt with maintenance and facility issues, and administered budgets. Beyond this, many of the richest aspects of the meeting minutes—bylaws about whom to admit and at what rate, statements on the need for a woman's hospital, and breakdowns of patients seen and treatments administered—are included in annual reports. In addition to detailed discussions of these subjects, annual reports will be of great interest to historians of women's education and employment. Researchers will be able to see how training of, and expectations for, women doctors and nurses evolved. Of particular interest are the regularly included rules for nurses, which lay out requirements for age, intelligence, character, behavior, and duties, and applications for the nurse training school, which include personal questions about marital status, children, health issues, height and weight, race, and religious denomination."

Although Fullerton comments on the war, local customs, and her work in the hospital, she devotes the bulk of her writing to the weather, friends she heard from or saw, home improvements, legal and business transactions, quotes from the Bible, other books, and friends' letters.",,"A number of interesting themes run through these diaries. The first is US participation in the war, a development of which Fullerton did not approve. The second, and most prominent, concerns her paternalistic attitudes toward locals and their customs, however, attention to such issues is sporadic. Attitudes of missionaries toward local customs, particularly &quot;child brides,&quot; is dealt with more extensively in WMCP's Alumnae Transactions, as is American medical women's participation in the war. Since Fullerton often transcribes friends' letters in full, it is often difficult to determine where quoted material ends and her own thoughts begin."

The Annual Announcement continued into the 1980s.","WMCP's Annual Announcements shed light on academics, demographics, and values. Increasingly detailed breakdowns of courses, recommended reading, and faculty members reveal a curriculum that grew more rigorous to support a profession that was becoming more specialized. Additionally, course offerings reveal the confluence between medicine and Progressive and feminist reform. A course on hygiene, eventually supported by the US Social Hygiene Board, included visits to factories, water-filtration plants, and other sites. It also addressed aspects of social medicine, including sex hygiene and control of venereal disease. Announcements also offer some insights into the kind of students who attended WMC, their career prospects after graduation, and the kinds of students WMC tried to recruit. In addition to listing places of residence for students and alumnae, as well as those in the latter category who received hospital appointments, announcements describe the kinds of financial aid available to prospective students. Of particular interest is the aid available to students who wish to become missionaries after graduation.","These announcements will be of interest to researchers studying the evolution of medical education. Course offerings and descriptions reveal much about the rigor of training and the subjects emphasized by the college, as well as something of the medical knowledge that existed at the time.

Discussions in particular offer a rare glimpse into the contested nature of various medical theories. However, this collection is perhaps most valuable for what it reveals about WMCP graduates' views on race, class, and gender. In particular, they saw it as their duty as enlightened American women to lift up women in other parts of the world—particularly India, where the phenomenon of &quot;child brides&quot; was especially concerning. This topic receives extensive coverage. Less prominently featured, but still included, are arguments that attribute racial and class disparities to biological factors.

Suffragists by this point were increasingly using public tactics; members of the Woman Suffrage Party of Logan held open-air meetings, hung banners across Broad Street, advertised in newspapers, staged theater performances, monitored polling places, attended hearings in the state legislature, and actively worked to defeat state politicians who voted against state suffrage. There is little to no discussion of some important national and even state-level developments in the suffrage movement; for example, minutes do not explicitly mention the failed 1915 state referendum, although they do discuss the successful 1919 state campaign. Originally the Germantown (Philadelphia) branch of the Woman Suffrage Party, this organization changed its name to the Pennsylvania League of Women Citizens in 1919, when Pennsylvania women won the right to vote.","The notable absences in these papers make it difficult for researchers to glean much about the particular trajectory of the Pennsylvania suffrage campaign.

Eliza Sproat Turner (1826-1903), a progressive women's activist, helped create both organizations. Over several decades, the trust oversaw and provided financial support for the guild's activities for women in the workforce. The records of the New Century Trust include their own and mostly those of the New Century Guild and its predecessor, New Century Working Women's Guild. Spanning from the mid-1800s to the early 2000s are board and committee meeting minutes, administrative files, membership materials including members' information cards, financial records, photographs, artifacts, clippings, and ephemera.","Although this is a large collection, the bulk of its materials are from the post-1920 period. Those that do fit into the project scope are, like meeting minutes, mostly procedural. They do, however, paint a picture of the New Century Guild as somewhere between a settlement house, a union, and a social club by and for self-supporting women. Both meeting minutes and office account books also provide insight into the kinds of evening classes the Guild offered. Given that the organization shared DNA with the Consumers League (Florence Kelley was a founder), it is not surprising that these sources place special emphasis on investigating and improving the working conditions of women and girls. Other points of discussion involved suffrage, home life and paid work, and women's contributions to the war effort. Extant copies of publications, clippings, conference programs, etc., date almost entirely from later in the 20th century.","Despite the presence of such prominent Philadelphians as Lucretia Blankenburg and Charlotte Peirce on the Executive Board, the fact that the Guild aimed to be an organization by and for working women allows their voices to come through. The Guild thus differed from many other organizations established for working women in the same era. Members were proud to work for wages and based much of their identity on this activity, particularly interesting given the wide range of occupations represented by the Guild's membership. These records will thus be interesting to historians of women, wage work, and class consciousness."

Extant materials include meeting minutes, annual reports, correspondence (mostly incoming), and a pamphlet addressed to the women of Pennsylvania. Documents espouse a version of abolitionism based on both Christian morality and natural rights, one that argued for women's special right and duty to combat the institution. They also discuss such seminal events as the 1837 murder of Elijah Lovejoy, the 1838 burning of Pennsylvania Hall, the controversy over women's participation in the 1840 antislavery convention in London, and, later, the Fugitive Slave Act, onset of war, Emancipation Proclamation, and more.",,"Historians have long recognized the significance of the Philadelphia Female Anti-Slavery Society, making these records very important. They shed light on some of the most vexing questions about the abolitionist movement, including whether women were able to participate on equal ground with men, the extent to which white abolitionists believed in full racial equality, whether the abolitionist movement truly changed from moral to political over time, and the extent to which women abolitionists drew on mainstream gender discourses to justify their participation."

The Association's activities were modeled after the work in London of Octavia Hill, with whom one of its founders, Helen Parrish, had studied. These records contain the personal diaries, correspondence, and notes of Helen Parrish (1888-1943), as well as reports, legislative files, correspondence, publications, and clippings of the Octavia Hill Association (1880-1970). Also included are glass lantern slides, negatives, and photographic reprints relating to the Association's properties and community activities, and depicting housing interiors and exteriors before and after renovations, court yards, and street scenes around Philadelphia.","The diaries detail Helen Parrish's &quot;friendly visits&quot; to her tenants. Like other early social welfare work, these visits were incredibly invasive, policing tenants' sexual behavior, childcare practices, financial decisions, and drinking habits. Race relations, especially interracial relationships, come up frequently. Interestingly, unlike social welfare programs aimed exclusively at women (mothers' pensions, for example, and, later, ADC), Parrish policed the behavior of both men and women. She mentions many of the same people several times, making it possible for researchers to trace their stories. Correspondence is mostly incoming, including several letters from Octavia Hill and her sister, Miranda. Notes and speeches go the furthest in documenting the influences on Parrish and the OHA, as well as their very specific vision for how best to practice charity. Meanwhile, subseries on legislative involvement and speeches, conferences, and reports best document the actions the OHA pursued.","It is rare for historical figures to lay out their thoughts, influences, and goals so explicitly. Helen Parrish emerges as a figure as complex and compelling as Jane Addams, one whose life and work encapsulate the central paradox of Progressivism as both altruistic and coercive. This collection thus adds new evidence to the perennial debate over which characteristic more fundamentally describes this movement. Moreover, these papers reveal Philadelphia to be a city as important to Progressive reform as New York and Chicago, not only within the US but also as a hub in the transatlantic circulation of Progressive ideas."

As minutes, reports, and other sources show, the YWCA Metropolitan Branch ran a boarding house, restaurant, lending library, employment bureau, and more. There is also a fair amount of information about women's contributions to the war effort. Within these administrative records are also hints of what the women who ran the YWCA believed about gender. Minutes, for instance, regularly include memorials to members who have died, providing not only biographical material but also indications of the qualities they valued and believed women should have. Reports and other documents note that their work was necessary to protect young working women from the temptations that their low wages would otherwise lead them to indulge in. While these papers thus shed light on the particular feminist vision of elite, white, Protestant women, there is little to provide insight into the experiences of members.","These papers would largely be of interest to two groups of researchers: those interested in institutions, particularly women's institutions, and those interested in late nineteenth and early twentieth-century attempts to curb urban &quot;vice.&quot; Historians can see how such campaigns were overlaid with assumptions about class, ideal womanhood, and other factors."

Of special interest in this collection is the Board and program minutes from the very beginning of Kensington Branch.","In addition to other association business, meeting minutes discuss in considerable detail the kinds of classes the branch should hold and the hiring of teachers and employees. Minutes also include some discussion of women's contributions to the war effort, supplemented by patriotic materials that can be found in scrapbooks. Program minutes from 1891 to 1900 are especially interesting. Early entries include narrative accounts of each evening's activities—how many young women came, what the night's entertainment was, etc. As evidence of the association's efficacy, they include quotations from attendees emphasizing how grateful they are and how anxious they are to get into classes (albeit from the perspective of board members). Later accounts feature class rosters with the names, addresses, and occupations of students. Many of them were domestic or factory workers (especially in the garment trades), but there were also a handful of dressmakers, tailoresses, clerks, stenographers, and teachers.","This collection is interesting largely as an institutional history or in the context of other, similar organizations formed around the same time, including but not limited to other YWCAs. Its target audience was somewhere between that of a settlement house and a working women's guild; while each involved elite women attempting to help those in need of aid, the class status of the second group was not identical.

Minutes and reports are exhaustive and sometimes redundant, as each committee collected others' reports and noted them in their own minutes. Of particular interest are their attempts to found a branch for African-American women, which is documented throughout the collection but especially in the Committee of 22 minutes. Other topics covered include debates over whether to affiliate with the Philadelphia YWCA, women's work conditions and labor laws, and contributions to the war effort. Two books included in the collection, The Handbook of the Young Women's Christian Association Movement (1916) and Elizabeth Wilson, Fifty Years of Association Work among Young Women (1916), provide detailed histories of the Y movement, although they are not specific to Philadelphia. The collection also includes a number of photographs; although many are from later in the 20th century, a handful depict leisure and athletic activities from the 1910s and 1920s.","In addition to comprehensive institutional documentation, the chronological scope of this collection offers the opportunity to chart changing ideas of ideal womanhood, especially as envisioned in cross-class relationships. While in the early years of the organization directors cast their patrons as &quot;women adrift,&quot; alternately downtrodden and wanton, in later years they appealed to their audience as modern, independent, and useful. For students in particular, this collection provides a good illustration of the shift from true to new womanhood."

Founded in 1819, the Female Hebrew Benevolent Society was the first Jewish charitable organization in Philadelphia, and the first such organization in the United States to offer free basic Jewish religious education. In the first year of operation, attendance at the school grew to 80 students, a number which represented nearly 90 percent of the Jewish children in Philadelphia at the time. The Female Hebrew Benevolent Society operated the Sunday School until 1858 when it was incorporated as the Hebrew Sunday School Society (HSSS). Rebecca Gratz served as president of the organization until she was 80 years of age. The Hebrew Sunday School Society records house the organizational records of HSSS. This collection, which dates from 1802 to 2002, consists of minutes, reports, correspondence, budgets and financial statements, staff and student lists, event programs, clippings, books and research materials, photographs, lantern slides, pins, plaques, and other memorabilia. These records and materials document the history and evolution of HSSS and evidence an organization concerned with the betterment of Jewish children through religious education, including those with special needs. The collection is a unique and rich example of the growth and establishment of the first Hebrew Sunday schools that existed outside of any synagogue, with records that provide a look into how decisions were made over the course of the Society's existence regarding what and how to teach, as well as a look into Jewish life in Philadelphia.","The pre-1920 materials in this collection shed significant light on the operations of the school. Minutes and annual reports describe academic activities and procedural matters, and there is also some insight into the school's educational philosophy. Students were to be as quiet as possible, stay in their desks, and repeat their teachers' words, and teachers were to be &quot;kind&quot; but &quot;strict.&quot; Also of interest are materials produced about students. For the school's 75th anniversary in 1889, administrators solicited notes from former students listing their dates of attendance. A list of those who responded appears in the event's program. The Northern School's record of pupils is also extant between 1890 and 1903. It includes students' names, ages, and addresses, as well as their fathers' (occasionally mothers') names and occupations, pointing to class and residential patterns.","These records are important for the history of Jewish institution building in Philadelphia, but they have less to say about the history of women's rights, although the very existence of the school reflects Rebecca Gratz's dedicated activism. Later remembrances of Gratz included in this collection do include some biographical information about her, but they shed more light on how she functioned as a symbol than on who she was as a person or activist."

The collection provides details about the planning and implementation of services at the center, designed to aid and improve the lives of the Jewish immigrant community in twentieth century Philadelphia.","Records related to the pre-1920 era, for most of which the organization was named the Young Women's Union, are scarce. The charter, constitution, and annual reports provide insight into the services the YWU provided for its neighbors, including a day nursery and shelter, kindergarten, gymnasium, library, sewing school, evening classes and clubs, and more. Annual reports also shed some light on how the YWU negotiated its relationship to mainstream American culture, including Americanization. Finally, papers document the YWU's connection to other Progressive institutions, especially the Children's Bureau.","Much of the scholarly work on settlement houses has focused on those established by elite Protestant women for immigrant communities who were largely Catholic and Jewish, investigating the power dynamics between these two very different groups. Less work has been done on activists who shared cultural points of reference with those they aimed to help, although historians have found that African American women who aimed to help other members of their community operated somewhat differently. These papers offer the opportunity to fill in another piece of this puzzle. Did a shared religion mitigate tensions between these two groups, and, if so, how does this relationship alter our understanding of Progressive reform more broadly?"

This collection contains admission registers for foster home wards, indenture agreements, annual reports, administrative records, and reports on the foster home. The admission registers record the names and ages of children entering the foster home, the date of entry, and in some cases nativity, an abbreviated statement of reason for placement, and date of discharge from the home. Some of the earliest records of admission also include indenture agreements or contracts signed by a parent or guardian binding the institution to provide food, clothing, medicine, and education for children placed there. In return, the parent or guardian committed the child to a stated number of years of labor. Administrative records in this series include Board of Managers meeting minutes, a near complete run of annual reports from 1856 to 1919, and documentation about the creation and administration of a fund to educate wards of the foster home through the Cassie Theobold Pfaelzer Trust. Also of note are the meeting minutes of the Girl's Literary Society, a group consisting of older female wards who engaged in literary recitation and musical performances for the benefit of the residents.",,"What makes these records interesting also makes it challenging to fit the collection under the scope of women's rights. Until 1875, managers and officers were all women, while men sat on the Board of Council. Starting in 1875, men filled the roles previously held by women, who were demoted to the associate board. As a result, their voices disappeared from annual reports, where previously they had expounded on the relationship between women and reform work in some detail. While this lends itself to comparing different reform strategies and philosophies, it also makes it difficult to locate women's agency."

Her work for suffrage and women's rights is also well-represented.","Pre-1920 materials are relatively sparse, although they provide some insight into Hull's Quaker upbringing and involvement in the peace and suffrage movements. A series of fliers reveals the strategies members of the Pennsylvania Woman Suffrage Association used to advance their cause, and a series of letters to, from, and about Jane Addams show how fond the two women were of each other.","Although Hull was involved in activism before 1920, her most important contributions were to Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, and these are the activities best represented by this collection .

Correspondence to and from Balch spans the years from 1875 until her death in 1961. A gap from 1907 until 1913 may have been caused by a fire at Wellesley in 1914, when many papers were destroyed. A considerable amount of important correspondence (1920-c. 1941) relates to the affairs of Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF), an international organization which Balch led for many years. Her writings (1884-1956) include articles and speeches--some published, others in manuscript, draft, or note form--as well as letters to the editor, book reviews, poems, a song, and research notes. There are many writings pertaining to Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF). Some books written by Balch are not microfilmed but can be found in the Swarthmore College Peace Collections library.","Before she became a peace activist, Emily Greene Balch was a member of Bryn Mawr's first graduating class (1889). Materials from this part of her life include letters to friends and family members, appointment books, lists of contacts, and occasional observations on issues like labor conditions and economic inequality. Later autobiographical writing also attributes her political awakening to her time at Bryn Mawr.","The significance of this collection to the current project largely depends on how parameters are defined. Balch was connected to Philadelphia because she was educated at Bryn Mawr, and materials from her years there do some shed light on how she became the activist that she did. However, other collections can likely make this connection in a stronger way. Materials from later in her life have a higher research value."

It includes original correspondence of Lucretia Mott and her husband, James M. Mott, with family and other reformers of their day. The collection also contains sermons, essays, and antislavery documents, and the diary of Lucretia Mott's trip to England to attend the World's Antislavery Convention of 1840.","The vast majority of this collection is made up of letters to and from Lucretia Mott, as well as third-party correspondence. As much newsy as political, Mott's letters to family and friends discuss daily goings-on, health, travel, etc., in addition to her reform work. A significant portion of her letters, especially outgoing, are copies of documents held in other repositories. The portion of the most concentrated interest is her diary from the 1840 World's Antislavery Convention, which speaks in detail about women's treatment both at the convention and in the movement more generally.","Lucretia Mott has long been recognized as the center of Philadelphia's abolitionist and reform community, and thus this collection is crucial for understanding not only her own work but also activism in the region and nation.

Educated at the Kimberton Boarding School, she also taught at a number of female seminaries, including a boarding school managed by her uncle, Bartholomew Fussell, and the Foster School for Girls at Clifton Springs, N.Y. Of particular interest is her correspondence with a cousin concerning phrenology and a school for black children in which he was teaching, and her manuscript memoirs of the Underground Railroad.","These papers offer windows into abolitionism, Quakers and militarism, and female friendships and professionalism. Graceanna Lewis belonged to a family of reformers and was in a circle that involved many others, including Cyrus and Charles Burleigh and William Still. Her correspondence addresses issues including the Abby Kelley controversy over female participation in antislavery work and the Underground Railroad. The latter is also addressed in an unpublished memoir Lewis wrote in 1912. She discussed her parents' opposition to slavery, the fugitives who hid on their property, and the contributions of other local abolitionists. Additionally, these papers shed light on the difficulties the Civil War posed to Quakers who were both antislavery and antiwar. Lewis's writings also show how her work was sometimes in concert with, and sometimes at odds with, her politics. As a teacher, she did not hesitate to talk to her students about slavery, even if their parents would object. However, she was also a scientist, which led her to embrace phrenology and scientific racism. A final thread that runs through this collection is that of female friendships, expressed in Lewis's lifelong friendship with Hannah Mifflin.","As noted, these papers engage with many interesting issues, but they are probably more valuable to supplement a study of the abolitionist community than they are as windows into Lewis's own life and activism. Additionally, while Lewis certainly exercised agency through her pursuit of an unconventional career, she did not really focus on the gendered aspects of slavery or on women's rights per se."

Her letters and diaries convey a harrowing picture of how the Civil War affected the daily lives of Northerners, as well as the ways in which Schofield contributed to the war effort, including sending food, sewing, and money; working in a hospital; and aiding contraband. Yet, as a Quaker, it was difficult to reconcile her antislavery sentiments with her pacifist beliefs, and her letters describe this struggle as well. In 1865, she was appointed a teacher with the Pennsylvania Relief Association, and from this point on sources document her move South, teaching, and eventually the establishment of her own school. Sources also chart her growing involvement in the suffrage movement, including her views on why women should have the right to vote and her friendship with Susan B. Anthony. The collection does include a few gaps—outgoing letters are less common after 1865, and diaries from 1863-64 and 1872-91 are not included—but each form is so compelling and revealing on its own. Schofield was remarkably candid and reflective, not only about politics but also about her personal life, including her friendship with Sadie Brower—a classic nineteenth-century romantic friendship that included referring to Sadie as her wife and deep depression when Sadie got married—and her attempts to map out unconventional relationships with men. Beyond letters and diaries, Schofield penned many articles on such issues as women's rights and racial equality.","Beyond charting Schofield's involvement in abolitionism, the war effort, educational initiatives, and suffrage, the collection documents the ways in which nineteenth-century women attempted to create satisfying lives for themselves outside of marriage and motherhood. Of particular interest is the fact that Schofield was so young (early twenties) when she produced much of this writing, making her relatable to students. Despite the presence of some cross-writing, her handwriting is highly readable."

Papers of Lucy Biddle Lewis (1861-1941) are important for association with the women's suffrage movement and for early activities of the American Friends Service Committee.","In letters to her family and a few friends, suffragist and peace activist Lucy Biddle Lewis described her trips to the Hague in 1915 and Zurich in 1919 for peace conferences. Her papers do not make up a tremendous amount of this collection, but the letters are quite detailed, descriptive, and interesting. They discuss Lewis's friendship with and fondness for Jane Addams, as well as her interactions with other prominent women, including Emily Greene Balch, Jeannette Rankin, and Florence Kelley. She also discusses topics including Wilson and the peace process, the state of postwar Europe, post-war relief efforts, Russian politics, and working with Hoover.","These letters serve as a nice, more candid supplement to the more official Woman's Peace Party papers, shedding light on some of the activists involved and the real, on-the-ground difficulties they faced in working for peace."

The stated objective was to solicit voluntary donations of money and goods to distribute to the Indian tribes assigned to the care of the Yearly Meeting. Collection includes printed and hand-written documents, correspondence, and financial records.","This is a small collection with scattered documents. Correspondence is mostly about donations and the distribution of goods, although it does include a few thank-you notes from aid recipients; other documentation is official or procedural in nature. Although women were involved in this organization, including in its leadership, there is not much documentation to connect their work explicitly to women's rights. The collection does document one interesting connection. The association sent Dr. Phebe Oliver, previously of the Woman's Hospital, to work on the Otoe reservation (letter from pres. Mary Jeanes, 1871).","While the material in this collection certainly corroborates the paternalism of such nineteenth-century benevolent organizations, the glimpses it provides into this world are not enough to base a project on."

Its mission was to provide employment in sewing for poor women. The collection contains legal documents, financial records, membership list (1849-1872), reports, correspondence, and related papers.","The most interesting documents in this collection are the single extant annual report (1849) and the Seybert Institution report (1918). The former documents the association's commitment to helping the &quot;worthy&quot; poor and its role as a precursor to modern social welfare organizations. The latter gives brief life histories of the women receiving aid through the association, albeit through the eyes of those conducting the report. Other documents are largely about donations, rules and procedures, and income and expenditures.","This organization is an interesting footnote in the history of women's benevolent and social welfare activism and in the life of cofounder Lucretia Mott, but the collection does not provide enough material for an in-depth investigation. It is interesting to note that they offered aid to both white and African-American women."

The collection contains correspondence, journals, other manuscripts, memorabilia, and images of Emily Howland and members of the Howland and Tallcot families. Topics covered include education, philanthropy, abolition, and women's rights.","Emily Howland's life included some similarities to Martha Schofield's, but their writing differed. Howland's letters and diaries are mostly newsy, focused on daily goings-on and activities. Only rarely does she discuss politics or her work or reflect on her feelings. Her reflective moments tend to be about religion, philosophy, or the natural world. The collection does not include diaries for the years in which she worked in a contraband camp and started her schools. The collection does include some interesting essays, including one on citizenship rights for women and African Americans. Her collection of suffrage badges and memorabilia is also noteworthy.","Emily Howland led a very interesting life, but she did not often comment on its most notable parts. Researchers hoping to find detailed information about her work with contraband, in schools for freedpeople, or for suffrage may find the day-to-day nature of this collection somewhat frustrating."

Rebecca's diaries in the form of booklets and individual pages are dated 1824-1847. Entries are not in order; some are on stray pages rather than in books, and some of the entries in books have been copied from stray &quot;scraps.&quot; Most entries concern Rebecca's religious feelings and her often-repeated desire to dedicate herself more and more fully to her faith. Some later entries describe her charitable visits to prisoners, the poor, the sick, and the patients of an insane asylum. One diary is dedicated to the illness and death of Rebecca's brother Henry, including accounts of the remedies offered by doctors, and of Henry's mental and spiritual condition.","Collins's main interlocutor was her husband; her letters to him largely concern religion, family, her and others' health, and her daily activities. The most interesting parts of this collection are diaries from the 1840s. While earlier writings focus on Collins's religious journey, later diaries describe her visits to prisons and almshouses in some detail, including descriptions of her interactions with prisoners. Visits include several trips to Blockley Almshouse, including one with Dorothy Dix , as well as to the Moral Reform Retreat for Coloured Women, Moyamensing Prison, the Magdalen Asylum, and the House of Refuge.","While not about women's rights per se, Collins's writings show how religion pushed women to be involved in public life. Like her friend Dorothy Dix, Collins felt that she had a right and a duty to enter spaces like almshouses and prisons, ministering to both women and men. Papers also offer a glimpse of how an elite Quaker woman viewed prisoners, the poor, &quot;women of immoral character&quot; (her emphasis) and more."

Meeting minutes are also administrative, dealing with the election of officers, finances, committee reports, facilities, and more.","Scattered observations do reveal what members of this organization believed about the causes of poverty and the role of women. Members remained tied to an individual rather than structural understanding of poverty, believing it was connected to sin and immorality. Thus, they aimed to help the &quot;worthy&quot; poor—widows in particular, or, as they put it, &quot;real widows&quot; (emphasis theirs).

For instance, they aided men as well as women, providing clothing, coal, and groceries to the infirm. They also aided women of different races and ethnicities, mentioning interactions with &quot;colour'd&quot; and German aid recipients.

Carey Thomas Collection at Bryn Mawr College is comprised of documents from two principal sources: Carey Thomas's personal papers and the official records surviving from her career at Bryn Mawr College. The third series is the Bryn Mawr School Papers. The fourth series is comprised of six photograph albums compiled by Carrie Chapman Catt depicting the history of the women's suffrage movement. M. Carey Thomas's personal papers consist of incoming and outgoing correspondence, family letters, autobiographical papers, business records, memorabilia and other miscellaneous materials. The college archives also includes Trustees' minutes, annual reports of the presidents to the Board of Trustees, faculty and administrative committee minutes, college bulletins and other publications which are not organized as presidential papers and are not included in the microfilm.","This collection is particularly rich in documenting Thomas's commitment first and foremost to women's education as the basis for equality and secondarily her participation in the suffrage movement. Never one to mince words, her personality—judgmental and demanding but also indefatigable, funny, and erudite—comes across clearly even in official documents. Materials related to the college document daily goings-on, Thomas's educational philosophy, including the need for women's education in particular, and, perhaps most interestingly, her close involvement in the lives of her students. Copious documentation of her chapel addresses, which she gave several times a week, are especially fascinating. Here, she shared announcements, college business, and disciplinary actions, and she gave lessons in history, scripture, and reform. Interactions with students and ad-libs are also included. Her letters to Anna Howard Shaw and others, addresses to NAWSA conventions, and other documents identify her specific place in the suffrage movement. Firmly on the side of NAWSA in its conflict with the Congressional Union, she considered the newer group as &quot;hopelessly untruthful as the…anti-suffragists.&quot; (Later, however, she supported the ERA.) Thomas's arguments in favor of suffrage often revealed a deep conservatism—she related a story of how her mother became a suffragist after she had to hold the reins for her &quot;ignorant negro coachman&quot; so he could vote and often spoke of the necessity of educated women's votes to cancel out those of &quot;foreign,&quot; &quot;ignorant,&quot; and &quot;criminal&quot; men—but she also emphasized working women's need for the vote. Carrie Chapman Catt albums, while not related to Thomas per se, provide a visual record of the movement.","This collection will be especially interesting to historians of education, especially women and education; although Thomas was involved in many other issues, even this participation was often connected to education in some way. Many of Thomas's letters, articles, and speeches were about the quality of American education more generally, although she also, of course, took a particular interest in arguing for women's education, the values of single-sex vs. coed education, and refuting the arguments of people such as Edward Clarke. From an institutional perspective, relationships between and among students, faculty, and administration—often contentious—also receive a great deal of coverage."

Bound into nine by twelve green scrapbooks with her name stamped on the front in gold letters, the diary was expanded to include photographs, invitations, play programs, examinations, clippings, and lists of books she had read. Mary Worthington's is not a mere line-a-day jotting of appointments and weather. Page after numbered page of thoughtful, often idealistic, narrative draws the reader into her life. She was young, she was an ardent suffragist, she was a member of the English Quaker Whitall family, she was a college woman shortly after the turn of the century.",,"These diaries are both delightful and revealing, with Worthington moving seamlessly from discussions of extracurricular activities, especially theater, handsome young men, bickering among friends, and rivalries between classes to such issues as suffrage, Free Trade, socialism, and government corruption. In describing both her own and her friends' and classmates' views, Worthington shows how a generation of young women was coming to terms with changing social and political mores, as well as some of the motivations of these second-generation Progressives."

They document how important learning, erudition, aesthetics, and faith were to members of the black elite, but they also shed light on gender norms within this community. Included are some interesting elements of gender conservatism, including odes to domesticity, submission, and motherhood. Frederick Douglass's entry in the Cassey album contrasts the &quot;beauty, elegance, and refinement&quot; of the album with his own duty &quot;to grapple with huge wrong--with gigantic tyranny--to launch the fierce denunciations of outraged and indignant men at the hoary headed oppression!,&quot; suggesting that these two worlds were incompatible. It would be of great interest to historians, then, to see if and how this context manifested itself in women's activism in such organizations as the Philadelphia Female Antislavery Society."

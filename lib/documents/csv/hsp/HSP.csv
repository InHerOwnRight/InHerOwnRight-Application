After proving her ability to publicize NAWSA's events and goals, she joined the organization's national membership committee and became the executive secretary. After the suffrage movement split between those who wanted to obtain suffrage through the states and those who thought an amendment to the constitution had the best chances, Katzenstein threw her support behind the amendment strategy. She helped found the National Woman's Party, which proved key in convincing the federal government to seriously consider giving women the right to vote.",,"Caroline Katzenstein papers | http://hsp.org/sites/default/files/legacy_files/migrated/findingaidam8996katzenstein.pdf",,,,,"Caroline Katzenstein papers"

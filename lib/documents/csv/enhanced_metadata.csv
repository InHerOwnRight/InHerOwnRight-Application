Miss E. M. Browne,
 
Dear Madame,
My education after leaving
High School was devoted to music both
vocal and piano. I went to work to pay
my tuition for my lessons but finally
had to give up music as it was so
expensive. I have been a teacher in
piano to beginners and I am well known
throughout Providence as a soloist in
church and private concerts etc.
Before being employed at my
present occupation I was employed
for several months as nurse maid for

two small boys (twins) having full charge
before leaving their employment their
parents Mr. and Mrs. Bartlett on 253

I have also studied and am interested
in psychology and efficiency. 
I [?] that I have ability to nurse.
I hope that I will hear from you
soon. I am,
Very truly,

Received your letter and its content and have filled out the application blank and hope it will prove to be satisfactory to you.
 
With the application blank I am sending you some recommendation of some of the prominent
 
[Page 2]
People in our town who have always known me.
 
Had been with Mrs. Milnor until the 1st of Apr. then she moved from our vicinity to Wmsport to the address given on the application blank and you can refer to her if you desire to.
 
In regard to the Pastor as we have no colored churches in our town I was a member of the German Lutheran we have not
 
[Page 3]
Had a regular minister until some time ago and I am just merely acquainted with him. I was brought up in the Lutheran church and Sunday school all my life and the recommendations will tell you I have always been and tried to do my duty every place.
 
As we have no Photography in town and I have not had any pictures taken lately I don’t have any to send you at present but if
 
[Page 4]
I must send one I will try and have some made. I am a very light brown skin and have very dark brown hair.
 
Hoping I may be satisfactory to you and please let me know if I will be able to obtain a position you will be waiting for an early reply.
 
Very truly yours,

Dear Sir:
 
Will you kindly give me information of requirements for attending the school of training for female nurses. I am twenty-six, have graduated from Cassopolis, Mich High School, since which time  I have done housework.
 
I wish to better myself and be more useful to my own race in the future and I think I would enjoy the nursing. I have no permanent home but am always welcome in the family of Mr. Fisk, druggist in Cassopolis, they are one of the best families in the town and I made my home with them during my school life, they will gladly vouch for me, as to character [strikeout]etc.[strikeout] etc. Colored students are not accepted in the training schools here, else I would remain. [Finally] let me here if there is any [strikeout]opportunity[strikeout] opportunity to earn my way while training as I have no capital. 
 
Sincerely Yours,
 
Miss Lovice Jones

Having pastored in her town, and but recently moved here where I am engaged as pastor of the above named church.
She is a good christian lady, having been baptised by my hands about five years ago as near as I can remember.
I believe she is honest and upright, and one who will do all in her power to succeed in whatever vocation to which she may be called.

Dear R,
 
Yes, with heart felt [sic] gratitude I accept thy valuable gift. The life of Stephen Grelet [Grellet] must be a treasure to the Christian pilgrim. 
 
Thanks to my Heavenly Father’s tender love and sweet remembrance, it came a birthday gift. Today I am fifty four years old! To how little purpose have I lived!! For more than thirty years I have been teaching others, yet how little have I learned myself of the great Teacher of Nazareth. ‘Tis past meridian, my face is towards [p. 2] the setting sun. What have I gathered for life’s evening? What for this world? What for the next? For this life there is (seemingly) nothing but poverty, contempt, trial! For the next I have, O, glorious thought, hope in Christ!! Then oh my soul,
 
“Then trim thy light, 
And get thy jewels all reset; 
‘’Tis past meridian, but still bright
And lacks some hours to sunset yet.’
At fifty four, 
Be strong and true;
Scour off thy rust and shine anew. 
‘Tis yet high day thy staff resume, 
And fight fresh battles for the truth;
For what is age but youth’s full bloom
[p. 3] A riper more transcendent youth!
 
A [underlined] wedge of gold [/underlined] is [underlined] never [/underlined] old;
Streams broader grow as downward rolled.
Keep thy locks wet with morning dew, 
And freely let thy graces flow; 
For life well spent is ever new, 
And [underlined] years anointed younger grow. [/underlined]
So work away;
Be young for aye;
From sunset breaking into day.”
 
I am much interested in your school and rejoice to hear that it is prospering. I pray that the Divine blessing may rest upon it. 
 
I have a large school and many lazy children. I feel so poor and ignorant, so barren and empty, that I tremble when the hour [p. 4] for school arrives. While I was in the country I prayed often “Anoint me anew for the work I humbly believe thou hast given me to do.” I sometimes think this state is in answer to my petition. Dost thou not think it may be?
 
My heart often turns to thee in tender love but I do not write for fear of tasking thee. I have written thy name and mine in the books thou hast so kindly sent, may they be found written in the “Lamb’s book of Life”, 
Prays fervently,
S. M. Douglass.

My dear Friend, 
 
I have been invited by my New York sisters to lecture to them. Our managers have kindly consented to my going. I did not inform thee of it before because the time had not been fixed. Now if nothing occur [sic] to prevent I am going on the 10th of next. It seems a weighty service. I doubt not I shall have thy warm sympathy. I hope you now have comfortable health and your sister also. When I read “Ragged Homes.” I thought of thee, and wished thou wert well enough to go into such homes in this city and that I could go with thee.
 
My husband was quite ill last week with neuralgia in his left eye, he is now able to go out though not well. With love to your sister,
  
I am affectionately yours. S.M.D.

I thank you kindly for Baikes’ work on Africa. I have not had time to read it, my brother carried it home with him and wishes me to thank you for him. He reads every thing he can get on the subject. I do not want him to go, but as he wishes it, and I cannot prevent it, I have at length yielded to it. I am deeply interested in Africa but do not feel willing to give up my brother to go there. However, I have laid the matter (where I endeavor to lay all my burdens) before Him who says “ Cast thy burden on the Lord and he [underlined] will [p.2] sustain [/underlined] thee” and am trying to wait patiently for the end. I feel deep sympathy for those who are called to a missionary life in that far off, glorious, but long neglected land.
 
I think with deep interest of those who may be [underlined] truly called [/underlined] to the work! Holy men and women [underlined] called of God, [/underlined] and annointed [sic] by [underlined] him! [/underlined] Qualified by him! Bearing with them that meek, loving, earnest, working spirit that made Justine Johnson so eminently useful. There is a very interesting young woman now in my school whose husband is going out as [p. 3] missionary to Africa and she wishes to qualify her self [sic] to help him teach; She is a very delicate looking little creature and seems, as far as I can judge, to have the right spirit, she is gentle, humble and affectionate. I am thankful to have the influence of such an [sic] one in my school. 
 
Nearly all my “smart [illegible]” are gone down, “higher”, I have suffered in parting with them, for I was tenderly attached to them. Every day the six come in a band at mid-morning recess to greet me with bright faces and loving words, and when they go away a shadow seems to fall upon me. [p. 4] Dear R, will you please give me that poor sketch of Grandfather Bustill. One of the family wishes a copy and I have none to give. 
 
11 mo. 28. This note, dear friend, was begun the day after I received thy acceptable present, but I found no time to finish until today. I often think of you, with kindest wishes for your present and everlasting good. I work very hard just now, and recreate by attending Ann Preston’s lectures. I cannot describe the pure intellectual enjoyment they give me. How marvelously has God fashioned these poor bodies! How imperative the duty that they be used to his glory. [underlined] Can [p. 6] we use them to his glory if we are wholly ignorant of the laws which he has laid down for their proper government? I think not. Then light, more light, for the people that they “may read, mark, learn and inwardly digest.
 
[Margin] Have you heard recently of my beloved friend Hetty Williams? [/margin]
 
I hope to begin my lectures next month. I see duty clearly, yet I shrink and shiver and feel [underlined] so little! [/underlined]
 
“Oh thou my voice inspire

I like Ann Preston as a teacher of Physiology. I have heard several eminent Professors but she excels them all in bringing great truths [underlined] clearly [/underlined] [p. 5] before her pupils.
 
I fear we are going to lose one of our Teachers, Robert Campbell, he has the African fever badly. We shall miss him sadly, he has ever been kind and loving to us. Always looking bright and pleasant and ever on the alert to do some kind office. I am ready to weep when I think of his leaving us. How thankful I feel for our good managers. I am especially grateful to Thomas Wistar and Israel Johnson, our exercise for the Institution seems to run parallel and we have sometimes been favoured to take “sweet counsel together.” I have a budget of talk for thee, dear R, but [cross-hatched] I fear I should tire thee out, so ‘tis well I have no time. Much love to your sister. Fare thee well, is my fervent prayer. S. M. Douglass

My dear R,
When I parted from you the day of our meeting I took my way home tearfully but glad, for the language of my grateful soul was was brought low and [illegible] me.  I had been so poorly in body and so anxious about my beloved brother who is about in [illegible] and very ill that I feared I should not be able to lecture, but I cast my [illegible] on the Lord and was [illegible] [illegible]llously sustained.  O let me praise him!
Our Heavenly Father, dear Rebecca, is helping you and your dear sister to do a good work - [p. 2] may his blessing rest upon you never grow weary nor faint in your minds.  Very precious are those [monthly?] faith [illegible]rings to me and very precious must they be to those poor needy mothers whose wants both temporal and spiritual you labor to effectively to supply.
I am very glad that you have Leticia [Brass?] in the school, her heart is the work.  May the great Teacher of Nazareth be her Teacher.
Dear R, I had anticipated great pleasure in spending a few days with you at Christmas, but I shall not be able to come.  Last week I received a letter from my absent brother, who still [p. 3] continues extremely ill.  He has the fever of the country accompanied with Dysentery.  Ill, and without [mercy?] above among strangers!!
I have been cast down into the very depths of sorrow and anxiety, and yet, my mind has been so impressed with the following text that drew my attention an [sic] opening my little book of “Promises of Scripture” that I believe God my Heavenly Father will spare his life “I have seen his ways and will heal him; I will lead him also and restore comfort unto him and to his mourners.”  Faith is hard put to it, but I must, I will trust, the [p. 4] weak miserable creature I seem to myself.  I am scarcely able to attend to my school duties.  How indeed, I can understand what the Psalmist meant when he Said “All thy waves and thy billows are gone over me.”
In this time of deep trial and proving very sweet to me has been the sympathy of some of my scholars.  One little girl writes thus.
“My dear Teacher,
I am sorry to see you look so sad.  I hope you are not sick, but if your brother is sick God knows what is best for us, we [p. 5] always have something to trouble us in this world.  Sometimes our faces look pleasant, but no pleasure knows what trouble is at heart.  Without trouble we cannot get to heaven.  There is a very pretty passage of Scripture which says “I cried unto the Lord with my voice, with my voice unto the Lord I did make my supplication.  I poured out my complaint before him, I showed before him my trouble.”
Another one says, “Let not your hearts be troubled, ye believe in God, believe also in me.”
Your affectionate scholar, 
Frances Robinson.
So you may see dear R, how my kind Heavenly Father strengthens and helps, me when I am brought low.
[p. 6] I thought perhaps this might encourage you to persevere in sowing good seed its [illegible]ing to the great His handman.
With much love to your sister I am very Affectionately yours.
Sean Ryan will see that I am not fit to mind.

You are very welcome my dear friend, to the account of the [?] physician, I copied it purposely for thee, and am glad that I can in my way please or oblige one whose sympathy has ever been so precious to me. 
Mayest thou find in the pure air of the country “health and cure”. O, be encouraged about your health, it seems to me that she who has wounded “waiteth to revive” both soul and body. 
Let me tell thee how the Lord sincerely comforts me. A few years ago (14 or 15) my precious mother brought from the Homestead at Burlington a little slip of 
[p.2]
Glycine or Wisteria which she planted in a little spot of earth, about three feet long, in our yard. It thrived and bore beautiful clusters of pale lilac flowers every summer during mother’s life. When she passed away we cherished it for her sake. Two years ago it died, as we supposed, as we saw nothing of it from that time. A quantity of coal ashes was thrown upon the spot and lay there all winter, about a week ago I scraped away the ashes and a day or two after judge of my surprise when I saw a little sprout of Glycine as long as my hand peeping up, green and fresh and bright literally beauty springing out of ashes. O, then rushed that sweet [?]
[p.3]
through my mind, “beauty shall spring out of ashes & life out of the dust. A little while thou shalt lie in the ground as the seed lies in the bosom of the earth, but thou shalt be raised again and thou shalt never die any more.” O, mother, there I thought of thee. O, dear R, without the [underlined]shadow[/underlined] of a doubt I believe that our mothers are gathered to the spirits of the just made perfect. Flowers have ever been to me earnest, solemn holy teachers. 
Many thanks for thy kind gift especially so as it helps me to praise God more abundantly. In the Seventh month, if nothing providential seems to present itself
[p. 4]
I am to be married. After a long season, of darkness, of deep searching and proving (in which I was enabled to say in sincerity “Thy will be done”) light has dawned uponne me and I go forward humbly and reverently in the fear of God. I very much need some sheeting with thy permission (so kindly given) I shall purchase with a part of thy gift what I need in that way. O, how precious is the love of God, he has filled thy heart with kindness to me his [?] warm and thou hast generously supplied my wants. May he give thee himself!
        As soon I have time I shall take great pleasure in copying the [?] of my dear old 
[p. 5]
Grandfather. It is indeed an honour to be the seed of the righteous. 
        I seem to be improving in health having returned to Hydropathy. I am now using wet bandaged sitting baths and foot baths. This week I have not had much palpitations. I hope that rest and country air during the vacation will set me up gain, and enable me to return to my school duties with new interest.
Fare thee well.
I am thy friend.

Dear friend,
 
Hetty Williams called to see me on Seventh day and said that she would convey a note to you for me, and so I could not resist the temptation of writing. It is Second day morning, 6 ‘o’clock, I am in my husband’s studay, [sic] a small three story back room overlooking, what seems to [underlined] me [/underlined] almost a Paradise of a yard, It is so sweet and pleasant, so still and quiet, (for the [p. 2] youngsters are not yet astir) the sun is throwing his beams on the tree tops making them glitter as they bend gracefully to and fro to the softest breezes that I am filled with gratitude. So shines the sun of Righteousness into my heart diffusing peace and joy. 
 
I do feel it an unspeakable mercy to be able to believe that I am in my right place. O, how earnestly, how reverently and humbly I crave the blessing of Heaven even that blessing that maketh rich [p. 3] and addeth no sorrow to it. I could pour out my heart to thee thus did I not feel assured of thy ready sympathy. If the love of our own poor fellow creatures is so precious to us, how much better is the love of Christ. So free and full, poured out upon us, all unworthy as we are, without stint or measure!
 
I rejoiced to hear that your health is improving. I hope on your return to be able to see you. I hope your sister is well. May our Heavenly Father bless [p. 4] and comfort you both is the fervent prayer of my heart. 
 
Very affectionately thy friend

My dear Rebecca,
        Thy friendly letter was sweetly refreshing and strength-ning to me.  I feel a deep concern that I may be found worthy of all the kindnesses I receive.  May our Heavenly Father return thee a thousand fold, all thou has done unto me for his sake.  En-closed I send a note from Jane Smith, I think it may encourage thee.

Phila 3rd Mo. 27, 1876
Dear Rebecca, 
It has been very pleasant to me to sit beside thee so often, during the past winter. I only lament that my power of helping has been so small. Many times I should have turned away discouraged if I had not remembered the language of the poet, where he says
 “It matters not, in this little while
Whether we work, or watch, or wait; 
So we fill the place He assigns us,
Be its service small or great.”
For my share of the good dispensed I am truly
[p. 2]
thankful. I think Betsy Gardener’s testimony to the value of the precious texts given to the mothers from week to week from thy own collection of texts should strengthen and encourage thee, my dear friend. She said the texts learned at those meetings had taught her sweet lessons of love and forgiveness for those who had deeply wronged her; and who, before she came to those meetings she thought she must ever hate. There, in that schoolroom, seemed the place of meeting with her precious Saviour, the dearest spot on earth. O, blessed and happy they; permitted to bring about
[p. 3]
such holy interviews. Surely great will be their reward in a coming day.
I wanted to tell thee a little about myself. On the 11th of 11th Mo. 75 It was just 50 years since God called me to the [?] and honorable office of Teacher. It seemed on that day that my Heavenly Father was pleased to remember that I had [underlined]tried[/underlined], in much weakness to be sure, to be a faithful shepherdess to the lambs committed by Him to my keeping. On the morning of that day he graciously condescended to speak in the ear of my soul “Well done good and faithful servant,
[p.4]
thou hast been faithful in a little I will make thee ruler over more. Enter into the joy of thy Lord. There seems to be a spiritual [?] over me. The greeting surprised me, so unworthy did I feel myself to be. I carried with me the sweetness of it all day long, and for many days, I have many things to say to thee and yet, I cannot say them now. One thing I may say I feel unbounded gratitude to my Heavenly Father for my sweet quiet home. I have trials, but that are blessings in disguise. One of my old scholars, here on a visit from South Carolina, said 
[p.5]
that she heard a person remark, (alluding to my suffering from Rheumatism and my being [underlined]obliged [/underlined] to go out every day rain or shine,) “Mrs. Douglass is draging out a miserable existence” O, said I eagerly, how she is mistaken! A miserable existence indeed! When I am doing the will of God concerning me! Doing the [underlined]work[/underlined] I [underlined]love[/underlined]; doing it with all my heart and soul and mind and strength!! Finding my rich reward in knowing my record is on high I have thoroughly enjoyed 
[written in margins of page 5]
A deep feeling of thankfulness this afternoon for my home. “I thank thee Father that I live.”
 
[p. 6]
Teaching this autumn and winter. Going out morning by morning, leaning on the strong arm of my invisible friend and reaching my schoolroom with thanksgivings and praises in my heart and on my lips.
And now, my dear and precious friend, may “The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God and the communion of the Holy Ghost be with thee now and ever. Amen.

Dear friend, 
        I can truly sympathize with thee in thy sad bereavement having drank deep draught from the same bitter cup. O, may he who has wounded make whole; may he give you resignation to his blessed will, and enable you to realize that He is [underlined]more[/underlined] than Father or Mother. 
        When I stood beside the open grave of thy precious mother this language of scripture sounded very sweetly in my spiritual ear. “When the ear heard me [?] it blessed me,

and when the eye saw me, it gave witness to me, Because I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless, and him that had no helper.

I feel thankful that we had so nice a meeting. After you left us the woman to whom Mrs. Richardson loaned “Hearts in Physiology” took apart the skull and hunted for the place where the eyestrings/muscles where [sic] fastened. She then explained several things connected with it quite satisfactorily to me, and to the wonder of her companions. Another woman told me that she had often felt what I described as coming from over-exertion. She said after washing all

And starching and hanging up till eleven o’ clock she had often at that late hour taken her sewing and awakened with her head ached and her eyes watered and yet she would persevere. Now she would rest herself and be better able to work next day.
 
I hope my lecture was simple enough to please dear Mrs. R. I believe there was only one big word in the middle and I qualified that [??] before it was fairly out. 
 
I am greatly encouraged to believe that a good work is begun. I seem to see that after a while a way will open for us

To visit them in their houses. Perhaps the time will come when we can go together; Thou, the “Lady Superintendent” and I (tho [sic] very unworthy) the “bible woman”
 
My heart goes out to the people with inexpressible longings for their present & everlasting good.
 
I feel unabated interest in my school.
 
I have been able by economy to purchase the beautiful print “Merry’s Dreams” for my school.
 
There it hangs looking beautifully, and inspiring my children with good pure holy thoughts; refining their taste and mending their hearts. One day I hope

Thou will come and hear them recite some sweet verses descriptive of it.

Dear Rebecca
 
I thank thee for thy kind note and should have replied to it earlier, but I wished to send thee some record of my lecture. 
 
I had but a small [crowd?] say about twenty most those who attended last year having gone to the Anti-Slavery Fair. George Ellington and his wife and their daughter Rebecca were present.
 
[pg. 1]
 
Edith Ellington is an old friend of my precious mother. They said they were much interested. Their presence encouraged me much. 
 
Dear R, I can readily forgive thee for having lost the paper it was no fault of thine, and if it had been, I could as freely forgive it as now. I have no copy, but I hope it may turn up one day. 
 
I thank thee for thy kind invitation but I shall not be able to accept it, as I have too much to do to leave home at this time.
 
[pg. 2]
 
I heartily rejoice to hear that thy health is improving, and I hope one day to see thee in my school room. The employment chosen for me by my dearest Mother has been a great blessing to me. May I be thankful. The old year is rapidly passing away. How solemn the sound of his retreating footsteps! Grace forever! May the new year bring to thee and to me, dear friend, new joys by bringing us nearer to our Heavenly father and friend. 
 
Farethee well

Preface to the album. 
Readers! within these folds you’ll find 
Effusions various as the wind, 
From numerous prolific brains, 
In sorrowful and merry strains. 
This little book, in prose or rhyme, 
Is meant to cheat old father Time, 
And so a tedious hour beguiles, 
With poetry in every style. 
Now, reader, as you find delight 
In scanning over what others write 
‘Tis hoped, in gratitude alone, 
You’ll add a tribute of you own, 
And thus, with our choice peice [sic] at least 
Enrich this mental pic-nic feast.

Sonnet.
(Original.)
My heart is lonely as a mateless bird,
Where melody no more shall charm the ear;
Once high above earth’s tallest mounts its soar’d,
Rejoicing in its unrestrained career:
It nestled in the downy clouds at even,
And wooed a brilliant star, that warmed
With such expressive notes, the drowsy heaven,
All thrilling with delight, forgot its nest.
But now it mutely broods in solemn sadness-
Soiled is its plumage - broken are its wings-
Nor shall bright Spring call forth its wonted gladness,
Nor joyous Summer soothe its sufferings:-
The fowler [underlined] Disappointment [/underlined] (roo the day!)
Hath taken fatal aim, and seized it as his prey.
W. L. G.

The
Fair Sex
When Eve bought wo to all mankind
Old Adam called her wo-man;
But when she woo’d with love so kind,
He then pronounced her woo-man.
But now with folly and with pride,
Their husbands keenly trimming,
The ladies are so full of whims,
THe people call the, whim-men.

To the lost One From Goethe
And now thou art no longer near!
From me O dearest, thou art flown!
Nor rings in my accustomed ear
A single word-a single tone.
As when, at morn, the wandered eye,
Pierces the air in vain to see
Where, hidden in the deep blue sky,
High up the lark goes singing free-
To wanders anxiously, my gaze,
Piercing the vale[sic], the bush, the grave,
On thee, still call my frequent lay:
O, come to me again dear love.

Her piece inter[illegible] they came.

Friendship
“Friendship! to thee unsullied joy belongs;

For hope where [illegible] she comes however fair;
Still fear the attendant of her path is these,

And holy [illegible] tell their mutual love,
Fair Friendship binds the whole celestial frame.
For love in Heaven and Friendship are the same.”

The Abolition Cause.
(Original.)
If ever there was a cause which established the disinterestedness, integrity and courage of its advocates, it is the cause of abolition in the United States. They who are contending for the immediate abolition of slavery,- the destruction of its friend and ally, the American Colonization Society,- and the bestowed of equal rights and privileges upon the whole colored population,- well knew what would be the consequences of their advocacy to themselves. They knew that slander would blacken their characters with infamy; that their rebukes and entreaties would be received with ridicule, anger and reproach; that persecution would assail them on the right hand and on the left; that the dungeon would yawn for their bodies; that the dagger of the assassin would gleam behind them; that the arm of power would be raised to crush them to the earth; that they would be branded as disturbers of the peace, as fanatics, madmen and incendiaries; that the heal of friendship would be lifted against them,
 
[Page 11 verso]
and love be turned into hatred, and confidence into suspicion, and respect into derision; that their worldly interests would be jeoparded [sic], and the honors and emoluments of office be withheld from their enjoyment. Knowing all this, still they dared all things, in order to save their country, and abolish the bloody system of slavery.  Will the base and the servile accuse them of being actuated by a hope of reward? - Reward! It is the reward which calumny gives to virtue; the reward which selfishness bestows upon benevolence; but nothing of worldly applause, or promotion, or fame. Yet they have a reward - and who will blame them for coveting it? It is the gratitude of the suffering and the oppressed - the approbation of a good conscience - the blessing of the Most High. To deter such souls from their purposes, or vanquish them in combat, is as impossible as to stop the rush of the ocean when the fierce Spirit of the storm rides upon its mountain billows.
O, the loftiness of that spirit which animates them! It towers above the Alps - it pierces beyond the clouds. O, the intensity of that flame of brotherly love which burns within their breasts! It never can burn out, nor can many waters extinguish it. O, the stability of that faith which sustains them under all their toils and trials! It is firmer than the
 
[Page 12]
Foundations of the earth - it is strong as the throne of God. O, the generous daring of that moral principle which inspires their hearts and governs their actions! Neither reproach nor persecution - neither wealth nor power - neither bolts nor bars - neither the gibbes nor the stake, shall be able to subdue it. They will not fail in strength, or faith, or courage, or zeal, or action. Lous as the tempest of opposition may rage around them, above it shall their rallying cry be heard in the thunder tone of heaven. Dark as their pathway may be, it shall blaze with the light of truth in their possession. Numberless as may be the enemies who surround them, they will not retreat from the field for He who is mightier than legions for men and devils is the Captain of their salvation, and will give them the victory. 
Wm. Lloyd Garrison.

“Forget me not”! - how sweet the token,
When early hours have faded long,
And hopes, as well as hearts are broken,
To know they still exist in song!
Thus, may the exile fondly dream of 
Many a drear and transient ray
And watchful memory catch a gleam
Each colouring of a by-gone day.
What tho’ the wave with ceaseless motion
Protracts the union of our lot:-
Our Hope’s the rook, which stems Time;s scorn;
Our Love’s the flower, “Forget me not.” M F.

My prayer for thee dearest, is warm from the heart,
Unmingled with flattery - unsullied by art,
Tis the first fervent wishes I’ve traced on this page,
May they ever attend thee, in youth and in age.
I pray that thy pathway on earth may be bright,
With Love for thy motto, and Hope for thy light;
That the sunshine of bliss, that now ‘lumines [sic] thy face,
To the sad tear of sorrow may never give place.
That the tide of affection, unsullied may flow,
Through the heart of thy Husband, in weal and woe;
As when first at the altar, he gave thee his heart;
From the love he then pledg’d [sic], may he never depart.
May those sweet buds of promise who sport as thy knee.
Be all that a Mother could wish them to be;
And these [strikethrough] [illegible] [/strikethrough] loved one, who twine themselves close round the heart,
From the counsels of virtue, may never depart.

The Bloom of Age.
A good woman never grows old. Years may pass over her head, but of benevolence and virtue dwell in her heart, she is as cheerful as when the spring of life first opened upon her [illegible].- When we look upon a good woman we never think of her age. She looks as charming as when the rose of youth bloomed on her cheek. That rose had not faded yet, it will never fade. In her family she is the life and delight. In her neighborhood she is the friend and blue factor. In the Church, the devout worshipper and the exemplary Christian, who does not respect and love the woman who has passed her days in acts of kindness and mercy. Who had been the friend of man and God, whose whole life has been a scene of [illegible] and love a devotion to truth and religion? We respect such a woman cannot grow old, she will always be fresh and busy but in spirit and active in humble deed of mercy and benevolence. If the young lady wished to retain the bloom and beauty of youth, let her love truth and virtue and to the dose of life she will retain the so feelings which now make life appear a garden of [illegible fresh and new.

Friendship
There is a charm in this name which defies the ingenuity of man to define; who but had felt its genial influence? Who, but loves to live, and think, and dwell upon the happiness it affords? The World indeed would be all “void and chaos,“ where it not for this holiest of principles.
To cherish the higher and nobler feeling of which our nature is susceptible; is sound philosophy. That man is stoically is blind, or something worse who admits the sociability of our nature, yet estranges himself from the tender embraces of Friendship.

Good Wives
Good wives to snails should be akin - 
Always their houses keep within
But not to carry Fashion’s hacks,
All they are worth upon their backs
Good wives like city clocks should chime
Be regular and keep in time
But not like city clocks aloud
Be heard by all the vulgar [around?].
Good wives like echoes still should do
Speak but when they are spoken to;
But not like echoes most absurd
Have for ever [sic] the last word.

“Oh! In our sterner manhood, when no ray
Of earlier sunshine glimmers on our way,
When girl with sins and sorrows, and the toil
Of cares which rear the bosom that they soil;
Oh! if there be in retrospection’s chain
One link that knits us with young dreams again,
One thought so sweet we scarcely dare to muse
On all the hoarded raptures it reviews, 
Which seems each constant in its backward range
The heart to soften, and its ties to change;
And every spring in unison to move,
It is the [underlined] memory of a mother’s love [/underlined].”

“Jason, a bold advent’rer sailed to claim,
The precious prize which rais’d his country’s fame;

To Colchis’ short to claim the Golden Fleece;
But first the Brazen footed Bulls he trained, 
And with hard yokes their stubborn necks restrtrained; 
Sow’d Serpents teeth, from which immediate rose
A Grove of lances, and a host of foes;
And charmed the watchful dragon to repose. 
These toils o’erpast, in peace he ends his days, 
And gains the tribute of immortal praise.
Be resolute in good, and you will find
All evils shrink before a constant Mind.”

“Oh, no not even when just we loved, 
Wert thou so dear as now thou art;
Thy beauty then my senses moved,
But now thy virtues bind my heart.
What was but passions sign before, 
Has since been turn’d to reasons vow
And though I then might love thee more, 
Trust me, I love the better now.
Although my heart in earlier youth, 
Might kindle with more wild desire;
Believe me, it has gained in truth,
Much more than it has lost in fire.
The flame now warms my inmost core,
That then but sparkle o’er my brow;
And, though I seamed to love thee more
Yet, oh, I love the better now.”

Instructing by example, though their Lord.
With weary steps the Syrian sands he trod,
Hunger and thirst and toil for them he bore;
Showed how to do the perfect will of God,
Teaching as men was never taught before.
Shall we not a brother’s burden bear - 
Feel for his woes, his [illegible] too forgive - 
In his dark days, in all his sunshine share, 
And learn in sympathy’s sweet bonds to live?”
P.F.C
 
[Page 22]
Sympathy
 
Sympathy, as it operates in view of distress, is that tender affection which is common to man. Though not equally strong in all, we presume it is not wholly extinct in any. Often has the weary traveller, far from his kindred and home been refreshed & nourished under the hospitable, though rude dome of the native child of the forest. Wild and untutored as he unquestionably is, yet does he give the clearest evidence of being fully alive to the generous principle that enters into the feelings of another’s woe. Ambition and the pride of power that push forward the hero in a cancer of blood & carnage, laying cities in ashes and strewing the ground with heaps of slain bodies; may for awhile, blunt this natural affection of humanity, but cannot wholly eradicate it. Napoleon Buonaparte, whose common & expressive phrase was, that “the heart of a politician should be in his head,” should on a certain occasion, that though his military habit and his unconquerable thirst for supreme power enabled him to behold unmoved the slaughter of human being by thousands and tens of thousands, that he was nevertheless susceptible of sympathetic feelings. “As he with others passed over a field of battle in Italy, he saw a houseless dog lying on the body of his slain master. The creature came towards them, then returned to the dead body, moaned over it pitifully, and seemed to … Whether it were the feeling of the moment continued Napoleon, the scene, the hour, or the circumstances itself, I was never so deeply affected by any thing which I have seen on a field of battle. 
[Page 22]
That man I thought, has perhaps had a house, fiends and comrades, and here he lies, deserted by everyone by his dog. How mysterious are the impressions to which we are subject! I was in the habit, without emotion, of ordering battles which was to decide the fate of a campaign, and could look with a dry eye on the execution of maneuvers which must be attended with much loss, and here I was moved - nay, painfully affected - by the cries & grief of a dog.” This tender feeling, implanted in the bosom of every man by the author of our being is evidently designed to excite us to acts of kindness & benevolence to our needy to distressed fellow creatures. And when it acts freely, unchecked by the selfish principle, mitigating the sufferings, soothing the sorrow of the aching heart, and binding up the wounds of bleeding humanity, it is then that human nature presents herself in a most amiable and lovely point of view. Who is not peculiarly struck at the moral beauty and sublimity of the good Samaritan as viewed in contract with the selfish Priest and Levite. 
	“No radiant pearl which crested fortune wears,
	No gem, that twinkling hangs from beauty’s ears,
	Nor the bright starts, which night’s blue arch adorns
	Nor rising suns that gild the vernal morn
	Shine with such luster, as the scar that breaks
	For other’s woe, down virtue’s manly checkes.”

The Night of Death
There’s beauty in the hues that paint
The sunset skies;
The beauty fades and soon grows faint 
The brilliant dyes
 
Night from her dim and dusky throne
Her gloom doth shed;
And darkness secends o’er all the zone

To my Dear Willie
Slumber, sweet infant
Thy spirit is free
THe portals of Heaven
Are open to thee
 
The hopes of fond parents 
Lie burried in gloom,
For the pride of their hearts
Is cold in the tomb
 
Then slumber, sweet babe
Nor wake from thy rest
Though thy fair form is dead
Thy spirit is blest
 
While bright birds were singing
There’s hymns to the dawn
He looked up to heaven
And hailed the sweet morn
 
Lo youthful and gentle
Hist soule passed away 
In calmness and quiet 
Like sunset’s soft ray
 
His Mother…

The florver-de-luce being one. Of these lack

To strew thee o’er and o’er.”

To Mary Anne
“I never cast a flower away, 
The gift of one who cared for me
A little flower, a faded flower,
But it was done reluctantly
 
I never loved [?] a last adieu 
To things familiar, but my heart 
Shrank with a feeling, almost pain,
Even from their lifelessness to part
 
I never spoke the word farewell 
But with an utterance faint
A heartsick yearning for the time
When it shall never more be spoken”

The Rights of Woman
 
While Europe’s eye is fixed on mighty things;
The fate of Empires and the fall of kings,
While quacks [?] of state must each produce his plan,
And even children lisp the Rights of Man;
Amid this mighty fuss, just let me mention,
The Rights of Woman merit some attention.
 
First, in the sexes’ Intermix’d connection,
One sacred right of Woman is Protection --
The tender flower that lifts its head, elate,
Helpless, must fall before the blast of fate,
Sunk on the earth, defac’d its lovely form,
Unless your shelter ward th’impending storm. --
 
Our second Right-- but needless here is caution,
To keep that night Inviolate’s the fashion,
Each man of sense has it so full before him,
He’d die before he’d wrong it--‘tis Decorum,--
There was, Indeed, In far less polished days,
A time, when rough rude man had naughty ways,
 
[p. 34 verso]
Would swagger, swear, get drunk, kick up a riot
Nay, even thus Invade a lady’s quiet,--
Now, thank our stars! These Gothic times are fled;
Now, well bred man--and you are all well bred
Most justly think (and we are much the gainers)
Such conduct neither spirit, act, nor manners. 
 
For Right the third, our last, our best, our dearest,
That right to fluttering female hearts the nearest,
Which even the Rights of Kings, In low prostration
Most humbly own--’tis dear, dear, Admiration!
In that blest sphere alone we live and move;
There taste that life of life--Immortal love.--
Smiles, glances, sighs, tears, fits, flirtations, airs,
‘Gainst such an host what flinty savage dares--
When, awful Beauty joins with all her charms,
Who is so rash as rise In rebel arms? 
 
But truce with kings, and truce with constitutions,
With bloody armaments and revolutions;
Let majesty own first attention summon,
Ah! Ca ira! the majesty of Women!

Sunday July 1st. 1888
Called in the [Derby?] to meet Mrs. 
D’s mother Luisa Williams, a 
charming old lady from Media and 
her [Mrs. D’s) daughter Teresa. 
Felt it would have a good influence 
over the D.O for use to [?]. 
Spoke to Father about his reach 
being so far back. He says he 
has left the money each week, and so Mrs. L must have been 
purloining it. 
 
Monday July 2nd
Have established for Robinson in 
637 as [?] caretaker. He is 
to scrub front and yard and keep the 
people off of steps. He is also 
whitewashing cellars, which [?]
left undone. I am to pay him 
for this, and $1.00 a month for 
caretaking. I assumed the 
rent collecting for myself today
having discussed Miss [D?]s 
 
[Page 2]
on Thursday. I found her rent book 
and the receipt books in a most 
hopeless bundle. She has quite 
confused the payments being due 
on such a date and them being made 
for the week ending [?] another. 
I shall have to see her, and have 
it straightened out if possible. 
Fisher and Clayton must [?]
necessarily behind. [Waples?]
[Gibson?] and [Derby?] also too [?]. 
A friend of Mrs. Waples and her
little girl are speaking Sunday
there, and wanted to rent room 
No. 4. Mrs. Addie Wilson -- at 
present a cook in the [?]
[?] / Mrs. [?] 
Superintendant / Her husband
works in Phila. They have been
separated on account of work (!)
but now he asks her to come and live
with him. Mrs. Fisher very angry
and upset about rents. Lectured
Clayton and Riley very decidedly.
 
[Page 3]
Spoke also of cleaning, and gave
a new [broom?] to Mrs. Waples for
the yard. A visit this eve-
ning from [Rodanan?] Paul. He
thinks it would be unwise to
[?] acting against
O’Brien or [Heuritt?] without strong
evidence.

516 Lo. 7th . ^ She says Katy Clayton
is office there. I asked her to have
a care of Katy to try and guard
her, and to let me know if
she thinks anything is going
wrong. I talked on Saturday
to James Gallagher. He says he
lives at 112 Union St. with his
brother / [illegible]  says she used to
live at Caroline’s / He has an older
vagabond brother who is always
about St. [Mary?] Street, and a 
younger one - who [seems?] [illegible] too
Though he is only a boy. I tried 
to find why he [illegible] about
so much and spoke of Katy.
He is well educated, and well 
dressed, and I [illegible] him [illegible]
be in other surroundings. He 
was in a [illegible] of war for three

too much of them for then they

named Green-leaf applied from

back the next day with his
wife. When I went to inquire 
why he did not, they said I 
would find his wife at [Nancy?]
 
[Page 6]
Brown’s and to ask for Sally
Harris. I did not do so, but
perhaps I ought to inquire
more, [illegible] take them even if
they are so flagrantly bad. Also 
James Robinson a good kind of
man came. I said I wanted
to see the wife who has been
away from him at work (? / for
some time, but she is a [strikethrough] cah [/strikethrough]
white woman I hear, and a 
pretty bad [lot?] as he [strikethrough] hear [/strikethrough] even
cannot find her. I told him I 
did not want a man alone.
The Jones’ friends have taken a 
room in Hirst Street, which is 
a pity.

cannot pay and I don’t know
quite what to do. When I
first took Miss D’s place I
scolded away, but I am
beginning to think she really
has paid her possible. One
week she [???] her shoes for 
me, & to-day she had been
traipsing all over to try & get
the money from her sons.
In the other house her daughter
paid I fancy. The boys are
supposed to give her 50 cts
a week apiece, making $1.50
but they don’t seem to & she
has to feed Katy. I really
am fond of her, & she ought to
have a cheaper room. Fisher
now has lumbago she says
& has been to a doctor. She
was very quiet on the bed,
& Rebecca Irene & Sarah were
with her. Nearly all have
had Cholera moribus and I
 
[page 41]
On Thursday she was cleaning
a very big fish after I was
in her room & I suspected He 
said he had left $1.25 on
Thurs. And then she began
Such a tantrum of rage. I 
fleed and so did he soon
but she followed down stairs
and all the while I was
trying to Explain his [book]
to [Druby] she was sream-
ing and cursing & ranting.
When I left she was quiet
but I wanted to tell
Fisher & to tell him before
her so that there might be 
no cause for her saying
that there was any inter
Course between us. Then I
saw Joe Robinson. told him
I had decided that if he
married the white girl he
cannot stay. Also that I do
not want the two women
to go there to see him.

If they do not, he may stay
until Sept. but she can-
not go there to live. I can’t
help visiting him, yet he is
a darkey. had a brother
from the Church upstairs
with him & an open Bible
in his hand. I said com-
plaints had been made. He
asked if Miss Whitaker were
one, & when I said Yes
he informed me that the man
who was with Mrs. W. so much stays
so much at her house has a
nice little wife & family up
town!
 
Monday. Mrs. [Waples] said she saw

I do wish there were some chance
of her doing differently but I
am afraid its useless to try.
I have been very worried
lest she should get our house
into a scrape. Mrs. [Druby]
Sleepy drunk but paid her
rent and went to bed [???]
very quiet.
 
Saturday 21st. Met Mary Harding
I had sent her a postal &
been trying to see her since I
heard she got the $5,000 pension.
I tried to persuade her to 
invest it. She has, she says,
that is she has lent it to a 
“friend” who pays her 6% with
out security. I told her she
must get a mortgage or some
thing. She was with Harding 
but says they have parted
company & that he has asked
for nothing. I hope she
will come again to see me.
 
[page 44]
Served a notice to leave by
the 30th or new tenants &
wrote a note also Explaining
putting the Envelope under
the door. Heard great up-
roar & found Rebecca in a
passion of fury against her
sister. the widow Clark
standing like a statue, but
ready to get mad at R or
someone. She soon quieted
down after Priscilla Brown
had departed. Clark was
very generous with [bananas] 
his boss had given him.
The boss has just had
[???] after being married
7 years with no family & he
& Rebecca are [sharing] the
triumph with real interest.
I then went into Fisher’s room
[neared] but resolved to let
him know that Mrs. F. has
Given me $1.00 each week
 
[page 45]
The [understanding]. Mrs. Bond
present also and I showed
him the premises. Told Clayton
she ought to have Katy ar-
rested when she beats her.
Mrs. Haines, a man & woman
appeared. He left & I told 
her she could not have more
company. She said she
would have them. & I hope
there will be no trouble. I
Wrote to Mr. Deringer, 1530
Spruce who was once their
landlord, and he left a
message here simply not to
rent to them. I have been
fearing that she meant just
to use this room as a shield
in case 511 Hirst is pulled.
She has hardly been in it
since she took it. and I have
feared that there might be
trouble. She said I had
told her there must be no
disorder, no drunkenness 
 
[page 46]
no swearing, but that she
had made no agreement not
to have company and she
would always have company
wherever her house was. Her
husband always has his
friends Sundays Etc. I think
there was a pack of cards on
the shelf & I almost wish
I had given her notice to-day.
The room looks so attractive
too much so to be right.
3 lovely pots of flowers on the 
window. I saw her on Mon-
day at her sister’s at 511. Where
she paid the rent. She has no
stove in the room, and did not
then seem to mean to cook
there at all. I said if she 
[???] from us, she must
make it her home, and
perhaps that is why she was 
there to-day. She is a really
intelligent young woman and

[underlined]Mon - Aug 27[/underlined] - 1888 Book 2.
Conversed with Powers about 
[Airs?] Gibson about saving Clayton 
about paying. Waples left word 
that he would not pay at all. 
So I told his wife he cared for. So 
many were out that I went back
in the afternoon. Monday week[illegible] 
be payday - & I mean to go till I 
get the rents. I had a satisfactory 
talk with the new tenant of 
no 4, Henderson. He seems better 
class. Irene refused to hold 
converse. I think Gibson’s see
priority & good breeding fall her, 
& makes her show her bad side 
more to others. I did not have 
time to grapple with her, as Derby 
Swearing & bad talking interrupted 
us. He had come home to find 
her so drunk she could hardly 
stand & he was very angry. I 
got him down stairs, he paid the 
week & I tried to make her p
romise not to go back to her beer he went & finally I had 
 
[Page 2]
to leave these to fight it out. 
Saw Fisher both he and she 
were very meek. She is too sick to [watch?] much poor thing, [illegible] 
I was lenient. Riley not home 
yet. 
 
[underlined]Wednes.[/underlined] Aug 29. Hannah’s letter
Sent me down pretty well worked 
up - took Waples a notice to 
leave but did not leave it as 
he had left word he would pay. 
Found Riley. 9.30 & not gone. 
I talked to him Monday - hardly 
gave him a chance to defend himself 
though he had not enough 
spunk or too much courtesy to 
get angry. Poor Mary. She 
sat perfectly meek and cowed 
while I berated him. It appears 
he got a place last week 
through Clark at $9.00 a week, 
but as it was really $3.00 a 
day’s worth(!). Laughing [?] oyster 
shells he wished out of it 
somehow. Got a letter from 
[illegible] laying  [page torn]
 
[Page 3]
give the Derbys notice to leave, or 
he will give up his position. 
He was up with them most of 
Monday night and they had 
high Tues. [illegible] I think she was 
in her room today but I could 
not get in. I have written 
to Louisa Williams her mother in 
Media. After this I went 
up to 637 - Katy Clayton 
helping me with keys etc. 
Had various applications - Katy 
was very nice until at the End I attacked her about 
working & helping to pay the rent. 
She left me in a very unfriendly 
mood. I gave her 10 cents 
for helping me. I felt that 
there was no use interviewing 
Waples. He is not sufficiently 
civilized. If he pays as he so 
well can, he can stay for his 
wife’s sake. He is not at home 
enough to make it necessary to 
dismiss. There is his account 
I think. Ida Hamies paid me a 
 
[Page 4]
long call & finally asked weekly
 if I would consider letting her 
have a room. She has moved into 
the upper [illegible] many which is a 
great relief. 
 
[underlined]Thursday[/underlined] 30, Derby still out.
Gibson left his money with 
Clark for me. I thought it was 
back rent in addition to what
I [illegible] was to give me, but it 
proved to be this week’s which 
he had taken from her as they 
are not on leases[illegible]. She was very 
pleasant with me. Green had 
the service place and through I 
left a letter for her about the 
yard it has not been touched. 
Mary Riley seems wretched. I 
want Harry to go to Kindly[illegible] [illegible] 
but his father objects. She still 
uses a bucket for the children
 in spite of all I say, and it often smells very badly (??) 
I told her that Harry & Bernice 
are old enough to go down 
stairs & that at any rate -
 
[Page 5] 
she must have a tin bucket (?) 
Fisher had nothing $ day. 
She seemed better. 
Week back later - found Derby who 
has been at work both yesterday & 
to-day. Told her she must go & 
have a long talk while I waited till 
after 6.30 hoping he would come in. 
He did not, so I left the notice. I 
would quarrel before for nothing on 
Sat. & Cal [illegible] on Monday night. 
She has not been at work while I 
was away she said. I think it 
is best for them to go. She seemed 
penitent & willowed[illegible] and gentle & 
rough all together - poor thing with 
her bruised eye and dirty gaps[illegible]. 
As soon as she drinks she becomes 
perfectly uncontrolled and terribly 
outspoken and swearing. He grows 
angry & drinks too and yet when 
they are sober they are gentle and 
nice enough. Last week on
the 24th I think Robinson moved
out of 637. I had understood
he would stay the month out
 
[Page 6]
& would give Agnes the rest of
the rent. I had paid him
for some work he did & the $1.00
discount (it really amounted to
that) for general change of the
building. I [illegible] that he 
should keep the front clean but
he don’t seem to have done that.
He thus had given me 4.25 out of 
The 6.00. It was not very
accurate or business like, but
our arrangement about the time
he should stay was vague. I told
he might stay the month out if
he worked. So i guess he did
not do wrong to go before. I got

here different on my part.

I went yesterday to find the reference of an applicant from a man named 
Hubert at 603. Mrs. Millis had spoken of him and I thought it might
be well to know him as a better class neighbor. I found him a sententious 
disagreeable political personage. He said he owned property there (his
own house & the saloon at Corner) & would like to be agent for out houses.
Also offered to get information about Pat O’Brien houses, who the owner
is and says Pat is assessed for [their?] renting by that agreement, but cannot
be the owner. Had another blow out with Henderson- he this
Time rather than Mrs. H who tried to keep the peace. He is exceedingly
sullen and disagreeable- the barrel was still in the yard-
I spoke of this and he made a fuss also about the ten cents due
on last week. I heartily wish they were out of there. Have
suggested to Green & wife to move to 635. Their room is
too small, and I fancy she has grown [rougher?] and [less?]
 
[p.2]
pleasant from contact with [the?] [others?]. THey now all pay on Monday excepting
Riley & Fisher. The yards was dirty. Gibson’s dogs multiply. I am afraid they must go. I have overlooked them this far, but the little things are horrid, and Irene does not clean much. This afternoon Sue and I were arranging the books. There was a trunk of a tree in from of O’Brien’s, a crowd & a most unrighteous discussion. It was very bad indeed and I ought to have gone for the police, but we just bore it, and after a long time when the police did appear I told them how bad it had been. I know I ought to have had it stopped, but I just simply was too weak.
Thursday 4th
Found Dr. Edwards pronouncing that the only chance for the Thomas baby was to take it at once  to the Children’s Hospital, hoping they would operate on its throat. I went up with Mr. & Mrs. T. in the [cart?], and they took hold of it at once, with a prompt [illegible] [illegible] that was beautiful. Dr. Wharton came in & they sent for Dr. Ashhurst so I left them there. On my way back I met Mamie & heard the tale, that I have since cut out of paper. Geo. Sparks is the James Shepheard who has been [living?] with Mamie, and with whom I have been conversing. The shooting

George Grant, colored, of No. 620 Barclay street, who shot George Spanks, also colored, of No. 635 St. Mary street, in the neck early last evening at a house on Lisbon street, below Hurst, was arraigned at the Central Police Station this morning.

Mamie still keeps the room, and is of course running to the hospital & posing as his wife. He must be very badly hurt; Mamie says he sent a message to her mother to pray for him.

She is the one, Aunt Susan wanted in case she should open the eating house. She has been cook for Mrs. Coleman & various hotels, and is going to get her husband to give up his position in the iron works & come to Phila. so that she can look after Aunt S.

Mon. Oct. 8. Day broken by going to Germantown, but went morning & afternoon, rents not very satisfactory but will get them in time. Irene again refused to scrub when I told her of it but perhaps she will get it done somehow as she did before. The Hendersons most amiable Waples has begun to go out to work. Richard still seems to refuse to give any money excepting every other week, and also only will grasp the idea of the round dollars. Sarah understands that it is $1.10 but he won’t. I have credited him with the $1.00 for each week instead of dividing it. Say if he pays 2.00 I put down in the receipts 1.00 for 2 weeks. So that he owes various 10 cts & I thought I could get them all in a lump. It would be less confusing. Jas. Shepheard is still very ill, Mamie says. Hilton brought his rent up in the evening here was afraid I was angry, likes the place & wants to stay. Fanny was taken with a queer

it. He is a very stubborn person, and a miser I think. Mary Riley says Chas. still ill, beats her at times, though she thinks he does not gamble now, but is home, and takes care more of her & the children.
Friday. Went to the hospital to find out about the baby. There it was, doing well, in a room all to itself with the nurse & its mother. They performed the operation (which is rarely done on such young babies-6 mos.) Very successfully and it may get thro’ all rightly. It looked so well and bright. Mrs. T. has been there all day but went home last night. Isn’t it fine, and I never dreamed that they were so gentle and kind and interested as they are. They are doing everything.

Way the market people supply them with food. This explains how they get on, which seemed inexplicable. Then by the odd jobs & her work they pay the rent. The rents at 635 not satisfactory. [Madlock?], Mary Ann the old woman who has no. 9 and is always out at work, pretends to bring the rent up here to me on Thursdays. She did not do this last week, and also shirked the scrubbing which I told her she must do. If there is any more difficulty about the rent & if she will not leave it with a neighbour, she had better be turned out at once. It is very unsatisfactory to have tenants who work all the time. I recommended Emma Sutton to get flannels & hope this will be followed up as she is delicate I think. Powers says Jimmy Whalen (Clayton’s nephew) spends all the nights, and eats his meals in her room. I have written to Gallen & this must be stopped. If

Fits or spasms on Saturday & they were very worried. I gave 50 cts again for medicine.
Tues. Went down for Clayton’s money as she did not have it yesterday.
Thurs, 11th. The Thomas Baby died at the Hospital on Tuesday & is to be buried today. The funeral is to cost $12.00. $6.00 has to be paid in advance, the other 6 in weekly payments to the undertaker afterward. I have {underline]lent[/underlined] her $4.00, this is to be paid back after the undertaker and must be collected rigidly. Not having the baby she can now go out to work more, and must get the money. Last week I told them I would forgive the rent for one week but that due today must be paid. I forgave it because the child was growing worse without my knowing it and I felt I might have done for it in ways to save them money perhaps had I known. Thomas works in the 5th street market, carrying home baskets. In this
 
[p.9] [3-5]
It goes on she must be turned out. He says Rebecca Clark also was carrying on. She has been drinking & drinks too much. 
Friday. Mary Ann Madlock left her keys here done up in newspaper. Evidently she has folded her tents & stolen away. Bon voyage.
On Thursday afternoon I took Miss Henderson down to see the buildings and something of the work. I hoped she might be willing to take my place. She was interested but declines to do it recommending a Miss Huntley. I find the people object to visitors. They do not want to see them.
Monday Oct. 15. James Shepheard is still so ill that I have not yet turned Mamie out. She says if I do she will only have to take another room so as to have a place to bury him from from in case he should die. Her mother thinks as they have lived together so long, it is
 
[p.10]
Right for her to do this. She lets the stairs get very dirty & does not keep things clean in general. As soon as he begins to mend, will try & make her [underlined]store[/underlined] her furniture & take a place. We have many talks & this is the general drift I hope to bring about. Found 617 very amiable took Fisher some beef tea. Had a note with the rent money from Green saying he will not pay again. Lizzie knew nothing of it. Powers filthier than ever. Gallen says he can find out no evidence as yet of Jimmy Whalen living at the Clayton’s. Katy still working at the laundry. Has an altercation with Gibson about the dogs & mess in the yard. Irene does not clean up, and they have barrels & boxes & truck. He says one puppy is Sarah’s
 
[p.11] [3-6]
Thurs. Oct 18. Took Miss Fox down. Puppies gone at 617. Also Barrel. Emma Sutton complained of Mamie Sharp. Mrs. Smith has taken her brother’s two children to live with her, he has broken up, and pays her $1.50 a week for keeping them. We told her she mifht do this on condition that she herself would be responsible for keeping the yard clean. If she does not do this, she must go. As it is instead of charging her more rent, as some compensation for the privelige[sic] of keeping the children. We must find out if Emory the brother-in-law lives [there?] too & this must be stopped. Now no one else will have any care of keeping the yard clea. Irene complained of the way Mrs. Henderson treated her. Mrs. H. [eavesdropped?] & just after we left the house she struck Irene & the street ran in to see the fight. Gave Henderson notice
 
[p.12]
Saturday 20th Gave Mamie Sharp notice to leave by Monday. Rented Annie Watson Room no. 20. She has 3 children & this little baby has two mos. old whose father she is suing for false pretences & hopes to get the money to support the child. Her own husband died two years ago. Saw Green & arranged about wood work, to have it taken off the hour 3rd story rooms at 617 & reset in the Library & no. 5. Also about [W.Co] at 637. Had a visit in the Library from Lizzie Green. She came to intercede for Mrs. Henderson, said Irene was in the family way & very irritable. That I must look at both sides. She was very amusing & nice. I told her of course it was impossible this time to excuse Henderson. She seemed to regret so much that Miss Fox should have been there to see. Said that Miss F. did not know how the tenants behaved & how
 
[p.13] [3-7]
much trouble I had with them, & she was sorry she should have been there at such a row.
Monday Oct. 22nd. Took Mrs, Thomas down and introduced her. THings pretty bad, but she took right hold.
Wed. Went down about Carpenter. Could not get Fisher out of her room and was afraid to insist. She had said on Monday she would move while they did it. Gibson was keeping in knocking off boards. Mamie Sharp still there.
Thurs. 25th. Mrs. Henderson still there, & she went to the magistrate. Constable said we had no power over her at all. That our rules were worthless & so we could do nothing, but for $1 he would try to scare her & make her go. He says we must have a regular lease drawn up and signed by each tenant by which they waive their right to the law of 1863 which provides a 3 mos. Notice for every lessee. Mrs. Thomas insisted on out getting these at once. Learning how to fill them and having all the tenants old & new sign them so that we should never have any trouble. I sent to the printers for them. 100 Moyer & Lesher 242 Richmond St
Mrs. T. will take us new tenants & do nothing about putting them out until we are on a firm legal foundation. After a while the constable went to Mrs. Henderson, and received free payment for his trouble from her. Then when he left she turned on us. We were in the 3rd story. Mrs. Thomas went out and listened then shower herself. “That is right” she said. “She has threatened” (she had indeed) “and blasphemed.” “The two
 
[p.14] [3-8]
Together are all that are necessary for issuing a warrant for her arrest.” We went after the constable, met him on 7th St. & had a very nice talk. He rents 517 S. 7 & many houses. He said we had best wait until Wed. as he had told her she could wait until them and if she does not go, we can them take action against her for threats & blasphemy. Mrs, Thomas is treasuring up all the fearful things she said to us. When we went back to the house two police appeared. Said they had been sent for. We said we had not done so, but were glad they had come, that the woman had been saying actionable things but we had decided to let her wait until Wed. As the constable had told her she might do, then we would proceed. Mrs. H. them said [underlined]she[/underlined] had sent for the police, (to arrest us?! perhaps) and added she had said nothing to Mrs. T. only to me, which showed she must
 
[p.15] 
have been a little awed by her. The police men then remarked that they thought we had a great deal of nerve to go among such people, that once a person had been thrown out of the window, in that house, which I thought an injudicious suggestion to Mrs. Henderson. James Shepherd[sic] came out of the hospital I saw him and Mamie [and?\ made a fuss. Then I
At any rate Friday at 2 I had the keys. I made them bring all the keys Thurs. night but probably they slept there, all the same! Rented the Suttons room 9 as well as 7. On Monday put John Bradshaw and wife in 6. He is the one who drinks but I hope will not be troublesome. Mamie Sharp says Isaac Emory does live with the Smiths.
 
[p.16] [3-9]
Monday Oct. 29. Employed Hilton to whitewash 617. Mrs. Thomas & I did everything together. I talk she listens but is ready with very judicious & prompt help whenever I ask her. Waples no money, and we gave him a notice to leave though Mrs. Thomas objected until he had signed a lease. Still the rent cannot go any longer, of course I don’t suppose he would go if we told him a notice is necessary & it might make trouble with the Hendersons. So we really did not see what else to do but to run the risk this once. I had a satisfactory talk with constable’s collector & paid $1.00 for [underlined]Tuesday[/underlined] filling out a lease as a [illegible]. Went down alone about whitewashing, Henderson very meek, begged to stay longer till next week. We had told her husband on Monday that if she did not go quietly we would have to issue the warrant on account of her threats. I find it is the elections that keep them & on that plea
 
[p.17]
They are to stay until Wed. morning. Her niece is there is a condition that made me feel she might detain them by her [confinement?], but I think we are safe from that I. I gave Hilton 1.50 on [illegible] for whitewashing. It is to cost 50 a room & 1.00 for entry.
Thursday Nov. 1st. Rented room no. 15 to Edward Ellis & wife, who have been living at 517 S. 7. We saw & had a satisfactory talk with Jesse Butcher whom I had never seen. We got all the tenants of 635 & 637 to sign the leases. Except Hilton & Sutton. The latter was not satisfied with one room so last week we had rented Emma no. 9 as well. $150 in adv. For the two. Today she gave back the keys. Said Wm. Henry would not leave the rent for it, and was not doing well. Mrs. Thomas hopes
